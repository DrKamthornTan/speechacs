What Are the Symptoms and Signs of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)?

Early recognition of both typical and atypical symptoms and signs of
coronary heart disease (CHD) can be lifesaving. Getting to the emergency
room, hospital, or your doctor as soon as symptoms start will allow for
rapid and appropriate examination, testing, and treatment. Let us review
these symptoms and signs in detail. The symptoms and signs of CHD and MI
are very similar. The medical terms used are angina, unstable angina,
and acute coronary syndrome of MI. The most common are listed below
(Figures 3.1 and 3.2). 1. Chest pain (angina). This is usually a
heaviness, pressure, fullness, tightness, discomfort, stabbing, or
squeezing in the middle of the chest (sternum) or in the left chest
area. It is often worse with exertion. The pain may be atypical,
however, and mimic heartburn. Patients may describe actual burning or
feel a cramp, ache, or even sharper pain. The chest pain may radiate to
the neck, jaw, arm, shoulder, or back (Figure 3.1). 2. Shortness of
breath (dyspnea). Shortness of breath can range from very mild to
severe, depending on how much the heart is damaged from reduced blood
and oxygen supply. It is often worse with exertion, especially if going
upstairs or walking on an incline. If you have heart failure, your
breathing can be worse when lying down. 3. Sweating. Often there can be
widespread cold sweating, even in the absence of a hot environment or
exertion. 4. Nausea or vomiting. This can also be mild to severe,
depending on the degree of heart damage due to reduced blood and oxygen
supply to the heart muscle. 5. Abdominal pain (epigastric), especially
in the upper abdomen between the lower ribs. 6. Fatigue. A sudden or
gradual change in your energy level, with more lethargy than expected
without a good cause, is frequent. 7. Dizziness, lightheadedness,
fainting, or passing out (syncope). 8. Palpitations with skipping of
heartbeats and fast or slow heart rate. 9. Numbness in the arms or
hands.

FIGURE 3.1 Various combinations of chest pain (angina and MI) and areas
of radiation to other areas of the body.

About 21% of women and 10% of men had no symptoms at all with an MI or
severe CHD. Men and women may respond differently to the symptoms of an
MI, particularly if the symptoms are vague.

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS The symptoms and signs of CHD and MI
can be mild or severe, typical or atypical, and will vary depending on
your gender. If you develop any of these then go to the nearest
emergency room or hospital. Time is critical in dealing with an MI and
may truly save your heart and your life!

New Concepts in Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)

Over the past few years there have been many new scientific
breakthroughs and published medical articles on coronary heart disease
(CHD). These new concepts include discussions on what causes CHD, how to
diagnose it correctly, and many new treatments for the prevention of
CHD. In this chapter, I will discuss many of these and explain the
implications for you and how to prevent CHD and MI.

CONCEPT 1 As reviewed in the last chapter, the blood vessel has only
three finite responses to an infinite number of insults: Vascular
inflammation. Vascular oxidative stress. Vascular immune dysfunction and
imbalance. A large number of insults stimulate various receptors on the
blood vessel leading to these three finite responses, which can be
measured in the blood or urine. Once these are identified, they can be
treated to prevent or slow the progression to CHD and MI. Finding the
genesis or beginning of this process and identification of these
insult(s), then removing them and treating any downstream problems, is
the new approach to CHD and MI.

CONCEPT 2 The blood vessel responds acutely to internal and external
insults that are “correct and normal”, but if these insults become
chronic, the result is a long-term severely abnormal and unregulated
arterial system that does not perform its normal functions. This leads
to preclinical abnormal labs and other tests, then preclinical CHD or
MI, and then clinical CHD and MI. The subsequent environmental–gene
interactions cause specific expression patterns by our genes that
produce downstream substances which damage the arteries. Proper
assessment, comprehension, and treatment of the top five CHD risk
factors, top 25 modifiable CHD risk factors, and the other 375 CHD risk
factors and the downstream substances are required to prevent CHD. These
risk factors will be reviewed in detail in Chapter 18.

CONCEPT 3 All cells are surrounded by a protective layer called a “cell
membrane”. This keeps unwanted things outside the cell and allows for
all the parts inside the cell to function normally and not become
damaged. All cell membranes are composed of “fatty acids”. These include
omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids—good fatty acids
that promote a healthy membrane which is elastic, soft, and “fluid
like”. However, other fatty acids, such as some long-chain saturated
fats (over C12 carbon length) and all trans fats are bad and damage the
cell membrane, making it hard, nonelastic, and stiff. When this happens,
the cell membrane leaks and the normal receptors of the membrane do not
work properly. The cell then becomes damaged inside, dysfunctional, and
eventually dies. This is the same process that happens in the coronary
arteries leading to CHD. It is important to make sure that the cell
membranes are mostly omega-3 and monounsaturated fatty acids. These are
contained in coldwater fish, nuts, olives and olive oil, and
supplements. Trans fats, such as those found in many processed foods,
hydrogenated oils, and saturated fats should be reduced to less than 10%
of total daily fat intake.

CONCEPT 4 There is a continuum of risks with the CHD risk factors that
affect the blood vessel. For example, a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg
is normal. For each increase in blood pressure by only 1 mm Hg the risk
for CHD increases. If you have high cholesterol, for each one mg
increase in LDL cholesterol the risk for CHD increases. If you have high
blood sugar or diabetes mellitus, each increase in your blood sugar by
one mg or your HbA1c by even one-tenth of a unit will increase CHD. This
leads initially to functional abnormalities such as glycocalyx and
endothelial dysfunction, and then to structural abnormalities such as
stiff arteries, plaque formation, decreased blood flow, CHD, and MI.

CONCEPT 5 You have known friends or family members who appear to do
everything right. They eat healthy foods, exercise, are not overweight,
do not smoke, get plenty of sleep, and do not have anxiety, stress, or
depression. However, one day they are diagnosed with CHD or have an MI
and possibly die. You have seen others who do not eat healthy, do not
exercise, are overweight, have CHD risk factors, or even smoke, who do
not get CHD or MI. You ask the important question, “Why? How can this
happen?” Do the risk factors translate into CHD? Does the absence of
risk factors translate into no CHD? There are many possible reasons for
these findings: 1. Genetics. Genetics are important in predicting the
risk for CHD. These are often not measured by your doctor (Chapters 9
and 10).

2.  Proper testing. We must measure more sensitive indicators for CHD
    and measure them earlier. For example, it is important to measure
    endothelial dysfunction and conduct other noninvasive tests on the
    vascular system and heart to determine if there is early CHD. If so,
    then an aggressive, early prevention, and treatment program is
    warranted.
3.  CHD risk factors. The standard or top five CHD risk factors, as they
    are often touted, do not adequately identify individuals at risk for
    CHD. In addition, there are over 400 CHD risk factors. These are not
    measured, not known by many doctors, or they are ignored. For
    example, blood pressure should be measured in the office, at home,
    and by using a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor. The blood
    cholesterol and other lipids should be measured using an advanced
    blood lipid testing method that measures not just total cholesterol,
    LDL, HDL, and triglycerides but also measures each of these related
    to particle numbers and size for LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. In
    addition, the HDL function should be measured.

A combination of targeted and integrated, personalized, and precision
treatments with genetics, nutrition, nutraceutical supplements,
vitamins, minerals, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, anti-immunological
agents, and drugs will be needed to reduce CHD.

CONCEPT 6 The cardiovascular disease starts very early in life (in
utero) and is subclinical for 10 to 30 years or more prior to any CHD
event. Endothelial and glycocalyx dysfunction is the earliest finding in
CHD. This is followed by changes in arterial stiffness, elasticity, and
cardiac changes. Functional changes in the cardiovascular system precede
structural changes. All of these changes must be detected early in life,
prevented, and treated.

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS CHD starts early in life, but it can be
identified with new cardiovascular testing that will allow early and
aggressive prevention and treatment. Assessment of the three finite
vascular responses, removing the vascular insult(s), and measuring
correctly all the CHD risk factors coupled with a personalized and
precision cardiovascular and genetics program will help to reduce CHD
and MI.

8 Is It a Heart Attack or

The Causes of Chest Pain Something Else?

You should never ignore any type of chest pain. When it occurs, go to
the nearest emergency department or the hospital for immediate
evaluation. Remember that CHD and MI are the number-one causes of death
in the US. There are many causes of chest pain that with variable
presentations with or without other symptoms. Many of these are
emergencies just like a heart attack and need immediate medical care as
they are life threatening. It is not your job to try to determine the
cause of the chest pain but to seek medical attention as soon as
possible.

REVIEW OF CHD SYMPTOMS 1. Pain with exercise that is diffuse or
substernal chest pressure, tightness, heaviness, chest pain, ache,
cramping, and stabbing or discomfort with or without radiation to the
arms, neck, shoulders, or back. 2. Shortness of breath (dyspnea). 3.
Sweating (diaphoresis). 4. Nausea and vomiting. 5. Dizziness. 6. Pale
color of face and skin. 7. Palpitations (fast or irregular heart rate).
8. Weakness and fatigue. 9. Stomach and abdominal pain with a “heart
burn sensation”.

CAUSES OF CHEST PAIN IN ADDITION TO CHD OR MI 1. Blood clot in the lung
called a pulmonary embolus (PE). 2. Lung disease, such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); chronic bronchitis; pleurisy (pain
that occurs with deep breathing from irritation of the lining around the
lung (pleura)); asthma; infections of all types (viral, bacteria,
fungal, tuberculosis); pneumonia; collapsed lung; sarcoidosis;
pneumothorax (air around the lung or air in the middle chest cavity);
pleural effusions. 3. Chest wall pain in the ribs, tendon, and ligaments
of the chest; muscle strain and inflammation of the muscles in the
chest; injured ribs (costochondritis or Tietze’s syndrome).

4.  Fibromyalgia (a disease of unknown cause with generalized muscle
    pain or aching).
5.  Slipping rib syndrome.
6.  Aortic aneurysm or dissection of the thoracic aorta that is in the
    chest. This is dilatation of the aorta or an actual tear in the
    aortic wall that can result in rapid blood loss, shock, and death.
7.  Pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).
8.  Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle).
9.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickened heart muscle that can block
    the flow of blood out of the heart (left ventricle)).
10. Abnormal heart valves, such as mitral valve prolapse. However, any
    valve can be involved with stenosis of leakage such as the aortic,
    tricuspid, or pulmonary valve, as well as the mitral valve.
11. Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries of the
    lung).
12. Coronary artery dissection (the wall of the artery separates with
    blood in the wall of the artery).
13. Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) (acid from the stomach goes into the
    esophagus).
14. Hiatal hernia (part of the stomach moves into the chest cavity
    through a hole in the diaphragm).
15. Peptic ulcer (stomach ulcer).
16. Gastritis (lining of the stomach has inflammation).
17. Esophageal spasms and contraction disorders.
18. Esophagus is missing contractions caused by nerve loss (achalasia).
19. Esophageal rupture.
20. Biliary tree diseases, spasm, dysfunction, gallstones.
21. Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.
22. Abnormalities in the deep structures in the chest cavity called the
    mediastinum, such as infections, abscess, bleeding, tumors, or
    enlarged lymph nodes.
23. Lung cancer.
24. Esophageal cancer.
25. Stomach cancer.
26. Herpes zoster (shingles).
27. Sickle cell crisis.
28. Stress, anxiety, or depression.

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS There are many causes of chest pain.
Some of these are serious and life threatening. Angina chest pain or MI
can have variable types of chest pain depending on age, gender, and
other issues. If you have chest pain with or without other symptoms you
need to get an immediate medical evaluation by your doctor, the

9 What Is in the Genes

CHD Genetics Part I That Place You at Risk

THE HUMAN GENOME

The human genome (all of your genes and DNA) is 99.9% identical to your
Paleolithic ancestors, but the changes in our nutrition, the
macronutrients (fats, proteins, and carbohydrates), and the
micronutrients (vitamins, antioxidants, minerals, and electrolytes) that
we consume have reduced our ability to prevent CHD and MI. (Table 9.1I)
There are many genes that have been identified that cause CHD and MI.
However, in some cases, a specific gene—which could have indicated a
positive family history—is not found. Vibrant America Labs has the best
genetic testing for CHD, MI, the CHD risk factors, and overall risk for
cardiovascular disease. The test is called CARDIA-X and can be done on
blood or saliva and ordered by your doctor (see the Sources section).
Vascular biology (the way that the arteries respond to our environment,
nutrition, supplements, drugs, and overall lifestyle), assumes a pivotal
role in CHD. Radical oxygen species (ROS) and radical nitrogen species
(RNS), coupled with impaired oxidative defense in the arteries, vascular
inflammation, vascular

can be altered. This is called “gene expression”. Gene expression means
that the gene may respond in a good way or a bad way depending on the

decrease in CHD depending on what the gene does related to a specific
stimulus such as nutrition, a supplement, lifestyle, or a drug (Figure
9.1I). Food is like the input into your computer. Food communicates with
and directs your genes to perform. Food is the information that directs
gene expression. This performance may be improved with good nutrition,
but it could be made worse with poor nutrition. The modern diet consists
of high sodium intake and low potassium and magnesium intake. In
addition, there is a lower dietary intake of fiber and complex
carbohydrates (vegetables), decreased consumption of fruits and
vegetables, and lower quality and quantity of protein, omega-3 fatty
acids (FA) (fish, nuts), and monounsaturated fats (MUFA) (nuts, olive
products, avocado). At the same time, there is an increased consumption
of inflammatory omega-6 FA (hydrogenated fats, fried foods, processed
foods), saturated fat (SFA) and trans fatty acids (TFA), sugar, and
simple or refined carbohydrate-containing foods. In addition, obesity
and our sedentary lifestyle with inadequate exercise, stress, excess
alcohol, and smoking increases the risk of CHD. The implications of the
genetic–nutrition/environmental connections mentioned above are
enormous, in relation to the prevention and treatment of CHD.

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS 1. Our modern diet is not healthy. We
consume too much sodium, refined sugars, bad fats (trans fats and some
saturated fats), and omega-6 fatty acids, but not enough potassium,
magnesium, fruit, fiber, vegetables, high-quality protein, omega-3 fatty
acids, and monounsaturated fats. These nutritional habits contribute to
CHD and MI. 2. Your genes interact with your nutrition and your
environment (gene expression) to determine your risk for CHD and MI. You
can test many CHD genes with CARDIA-X from Vibrant America Labs (see
Sources section).

9 What Is in the Genes

CHD Genetics Part II That Place You at Risk

The risk for CHD and MI is higher for individuals with a first-degree
relative who developed premature CHD (with a threshold at the age of 55
years for a male or 65 years for a female). This Kaplan–Meier curve
(Figure 9.1II) shows the risk of developing premature CHD with
percentages from zero to 100 on the vertical line. The horizontal line
shows the age of a parent that has CHD or MI. As you can see, before the
age of 55 for a male or age 65 for a female in your parents, your risk
for CHD and MI is quite high. However, the age of onset in the parent is
after that age, your CHD risk drops with each year. Numerous genes that
cause CHD or some of the risk factors, such as hypertension, high
cholesterol, or diabetes mellitus can be modified, that is change the
gene expression with treatment with a drug, a supplement, an
electrolyte, exercise, nutrition, or other lifestyle changes. There are
numerous genes for CHD that have now been discovered that help us to
understand the previously unknown details and causes underlying the
concept of “family history of CHD”. This genetic testing will allow your
doctor to measure many of the genes that cause CHD or the other risk
factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, or diabetes mellitus
and provide a more direct, integrated, personalized, and precision
treatment program without any of the guesswork. This means that your
risk for CHD will be reduced. The Cardia-X genetic profile from Vibrant
Labs America measures over 20 different genes related to CHD and CHD
risk factors. The “family history” is your primary risk factor to
develop CHD, and now you can find out what the specific genes are in
many cases. Genetics and nutrigenomics (the effect of nutrition and
supplements on genes) provide us with an expanded perspective on the
prevention and treatment of CHD. In CHD management, nutrigenomics
encompasses genetic testing and the identification of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that are part of your genes, nutrient–genetic
interactions, and how the genes express themselves. The genes may be
“turned on” or “turned off” by nutrition, supplements, drugs, and other
environmental or lifestyle factors. This is referred to as “gene
expression”. The majority of the CHD genes, once turned on, promote
vascular inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune dysfunction.
Regardless of the type of insult, coronary arteries respond to insults
via the same three mechanisms. Consequently, the inflammatory pathways
have become the primary focus in the management of genetic expression
and genetic risk for CHD. The prevention and the reduction of CHD are
not likely to improve without using genetic testing with

integrated, precision, and personalized cardiovascular medicine. Let us
look at some of these influences on your genes, such as nutrients and
nutrition, electrolytes, supplements, lifestyle, and drugs.

NUTRIENTS Nutritional factors provide information that determines
whether our genes are turned on or turned off, with a corresponding
beneficial or detrimental outcome. One change in a single nutrient, such
as magnesium, may cause 300 different changes in downstream mediators
and cell metabolism related to cardiovascular function and health. This
is just one example of environmental influences and the importance of
genetic expression. When there is interference with a metabolic pathway,
a single area of abnormality can result in a large number of defects and
a spoke-like effect in a wheel, resulting in a ripple of downstream
changes in many metabolic pathways.

EPIGENETICS There are several issues we want to define in patients. One
is their genetic profile, the genes they were dealt. There are also
epigenetic influences that are not genetic that alter the function of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in many different ways that can affect
future generations. These are called methylation, histone modifications,
and noncoding messenger ribonucleic acids (RNA). These influences are
not in the

NUTRITION Mediterranean Diet We know that the Mediterranean diet
(MedDiet) turns on numerous beneficial genetic pathways that can reduce
the risk for CHD, MI, hypertension, type II diabetes, and other
cardiovascular diseases. If you consume a Western diet, this will result
in totally different outcomes in terms of gene expression, since most of
the foods included in a Western dietary pattern have been shown to
express 30 to 40 different inflammatory, oxidative stress, and immune
pathways. The MedDiet has an advantageous effect on many genes. In a
clinical trial of this diet, prevalent beneficial effects were related
to CHD, MI, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and hypertension. The
Mediterranean diet, in combination with CoEnyzme Q 10 (CoQ10), has been
shown to be the most beneficial intervention for healthy aging and
preventing diseases related to chronic oxidative stress, hypertension,
and CHD. Changes in genetic expression toward a protective mode were
often associated with improvement in systemic markers for inflammation,
immune function, oxidative stress, hypertension, blood glucose, and CHD.

Pritikin and DASH Diets The Pritikin diet is one of the most effective
ways to turn off the gene expression that increases the risk for CHD,
hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The Pritikin diet can reduce
the risk of CHD by as much as 30–35%. That benefit is directly
correlated with the diet itself but is also enhanced when supplemented
with nutrients such as CoQ10. The DASH-1 and DASH-2 diets (Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension) have also been found beneficial in
relation to changes in inflammatory genes, reducing blood pressure, as
well as improved blood glucose, weight, and response to the types of
medications prescribed for hypertension.

SPECIFIC NUTRIENTS Electrolytes Electrolytes, particularly sodium,
potassium, and magnesium, can change genetic expression, salt
sensitivity, intravascular volume, blood pressure, and risk for CHD, MI,
cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and stroke.

genetic code but can be passed on from mother to fetus and from
generation to generation. For example, a mother that is malnourished
during pregnancy is more likely to have a child that develops
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or obesity later in life. The risk for
these diseases can then be passed on “epigenetically” to future
generations. The final aspect is gene expression, as genes express
themselves in response to nourishment or insults from different types of
information coming in from the environment. Genetics has become
important in determining not only the best nutritional program but also
medication use in many patients, based on their genetic profiles.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids affect a large number of genes
that reverse changes in our metabolic profile and in our genes that can
improve mitochondrial health. As a result, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
production goes up, cells are healthier, and patients live longer. ATP
is the energy produced by the mitochondria in our cells from the
metabolism of food. The mitochondria are like small “nuclear power
plants”. We know that omega-3 fatty acids by themselves have dramatic
effects on many receptors that can have enormous influences, reversing
inflammation, oxidative stress, blood pressure, and risk for CHD and MI.
In specific studies, omega-3 fats changed the expression of 610 genes in
men and 250 genes in women.

Monounsaturated Fats Olive oil, olives, and nuts contain monounsaturated
fat, which has a positive impact on different SNPs and receptors,
improving hypertension, CHD, and diabetes mellitus. Even without the
MedDiet, the regular ingestion of olive oil, olives, and nuts can have
dramatic and highly beneficial influences on genetic expression related
to the three finite vascular responses for reducing blood pressure and
CHD.

GENES RELEVANT TO CARDIOVASCULAR RISK Every patient should have their
cardiovascular genetics tested by their physician. This allows for an
integrated, precise, and personalized evaluation of CHD risk,
prevention, and treatment program with nutrition, supplements, or drugs
(see Figure 9.1II).

CHD and CHD Risk Factor Genes Gene 9p21 is one of the primary genes we
are now measuring that increases the risk of atherosclerosis, CHD, and
MI. Patients who have a heterozygote SNP (one-half of the gene) for 9p21
have a risk of CHD and MI that is increased by 50%. When a patient has a
homozygote SNP (both halves of the gene), the risk goes up to
approximately 100%. However, there are many other genes that should also
be evaluated not just for CHD but also for hypertension and dyslipidemia
(abnormal cholesterol). 9p21 also causes inflammation, plaque rupture,
thrombosis, aortic aneurysms, atherosclerosis, and diabetes mellitus.
GLU 1q25 increases the risk of CHD and MI in diabetes mellitus. APOE4
genotype increases the risk for CHD and MI. Management of risk factors
for patients with the APOE4 allele, especially with the homozygote E4/E4
type addresses issues such as: • Increased cholesterol absorption and
delayed clearance, resulting in higher serum LDL cholesterol (the bad
form of cholesterol).

• Increased CHD with smoking and alcohol intake and overall increased
incidence of MI, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia. • Inability to
repair the vascular endothelium to produce nitric oxide, resulting in an
increase in blood pressure. • Less response to statins for lowering
cholesterol. • The best reduction of LDL occurs through dietary
restriction of carbohydrates, with low-fat diets and omega-3 fatty
acids.

COMT Polymorphisms. One of the latest genes to be recommended for
evaluation is catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which provides
instructions for the breakdown of norepinephrine and epinephrine
(adrenaline). If this genetic SNP is present, the patient will have
higher levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the blood and urine,
with an increased risk of hypertension, CHD, and MI. There is a
variation in response depending on which of the specific COMT SNPs the
patient carries. For example, aspirin or vitamin E may be beneficial for
patients with one type of COMT SNP, but detrimental if one of the other
SNPs is present. Glutathione-Related SNPs. The risk of MI can be
increased by 71% if an SNP affecting glutathione metabolism (glutathione
peroxidase, GSH-Px) is present. This selenium-dependent enzyme expresses
different capacities to neutralize oxidative molecules related to
increases in oxidative stress and cardiovascular disease. For these
patients, glutathione peroxidase and selenium levels would be key
measurements to track for the risk of MI: • Low GSH-Px is a major CHD
and MI risk factor. • Higher levels of glutathione peroxidase support
more rapid recycling of glutathione, resulting in higher availability of
glutathione which is one of the most important antioxidants inside the
cell. • Increased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) decreases blood
pressure, CHD, and MI. 6p24.1 increases the risk for CHD and MI. ACE I/D
increases the risk for CHD, MI, hypertension, left ventricular
hypertrophy (heart enlargement), carotid artery disease, and kidney
failure. MTHFR (A1298C and C677T) is associated with CHD, MI,
methylation, endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, thrombosis, stroke,
and high homocysteine. CYP1A2. Caffeine intake in slow metabolizers
increases the risk for fast heart rate, hypertension, stiff arteries,
CHD, and MI. CYP 11 B2. Related hypertension, high aldosterone levels (a
hormone made in the adrenal gland that causes salt and water retention,
hypertension, and CHD). NOS 3. Patients have low levels of nitric oxide
and a higher risk for hypertension, CHD, and MI. MMP-2, MMP-9, and
TIMP-1. CHD, MI, and hypertension are more common.

GENES RELEVANT TO HYPERTENSION There are a whole host of genetic
influences on blood pressure. In fact, probably over 30 different genes
have been recognized to date, all of which are helpful in determining
both risk for hypertension and risk for CHD, MI, and stroke. These genes
are also helpful to determine the response to diet and nutrition,
various nutrients, supplements, electrolytes, caffeine, and medications
(Figure 9.1II and Box 9.1). BOX 9.1

Recommended Genetic Testing (Vibrant America Labs)

1.  9p21 causes inflammation, plaque rupture, thrombosis, aortic
    aneurysms atherosclerosis, CHD, MI, and diabetes mellitus
2.  6p24.1 causes CHD
3.  4q25 causes atrial fibrillation
4.  ACE I/D: hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, CHD, MI,
    carotid artery disease, and kidney failure
5.  COMT: CHD, MI, and hypertension
6.  1q25 (GLUL): CHD in diabetes
7.  APO E (E4/E4): CHD, lipids, and dietary response to fats.
8.  MTHFR (A1298C and C677T) for methylation, endothelial dysfunction,
    hypertension, thrombosis, CHD, MI stroke, and high homocysteine
    levels in the blood
9.  CYP 1A2: caffeine hypertension, CHD, and MI
10. Corin: hypertension
11. CYP 11 B2: hypertension and aldosterone and CHD
12. GSH-Px (glutathione peroxidase): CHD and MI
13. NOS 3: Nitric oxide, hypertension, and CHD
14. ADR B2: hypertension and DASH diet.
15. APO A1 and A2: cholesterol and other lipids
16. CYP4AII and CYP4F2: hypertension
17. MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1: CHD, MI, and hypertension
18. AGTR1, NR3C2, HSD11B1, and B2: hypertension
19. AT1R-AA (AT1R autoantibodies): hypertension
20. Blood group type A, B, and AB: thrombosis and CHD CYP-450-1A2. We
    know, for example, that someone who consumes caffeine, in the form
    of caffeinated coffee and tea, has the SNP cytochrome P-450-1A2, and
    is a slow metabolizer of caffeine, will have an increased risk of
    tachycardia (fast heart rate), hypertension, aortic stiffness, CHD,
    and MI. Of course, one could have the fast metabolizer type of SNP
    for caffeine detoxification and that will reduce their risk of all
    of these problems. The risk of having this gene is about 50% of the
    US population. The 50% of the population with this gene who are slow
    metabolizers of caffeine actually increase their risk directly based
    on the amount of caffeine consumption and their age. Before you
    drink caffeine (coffee, tea) you need to check the gene for
    cytochrome P-450 1A2 function. If you are a slow metabolizer of
    caffeine then you should stop taking caffeine from all sources.

GENES RELATED TO CHOLESTEROL AND DIABETES MELLITUS THAT INCREASE RISK
FOR CHD AND MI Cardiovascular SNPs. Obviously, there are large numbers
of cardiovascular SNPs that we could check. At this point, I recommend
testing for those that have the best validation and highest correlation
with risk prediction, are easily attainable, and have

CYP 11 B2. The CYP 11 B2 is related to resistant hypertension, salt and
water retention, increased blood volume, high aldosterone levels (a
hormone produced by the adrenal gland). and low blood potassium. Genetic
hypertension is best treated with the drugs spironolactone or
eplerenone. High aldosterone levels and hypertension both increase the
risk for CHD. CYP4A11. In terms of salt sensitivity and resistant
hypertension, one of the most important is CYP4A11 which relates to
sodium and water reabsorption and the role of the epithelial sodium
channel (ENaC) function in the kidney. These patients have avid
reabsorption of sodium in the kidney tubules from the ENaC which
increases the blood volume, blood pressure, and risk for CHD. This type
of hypertension is best treated with the drug Amiloride, which blocks
the ENaC and results in a diuresis of salt and water to lower the blood
pressure. Some of these patients may need a short- or long-term
treatment with another type of diuretic, Indapamide. ACE I/D. The ACE
I/D (DD allele) is associated with hypertension, left ventricular
hypertrophy (enlargement of the heart), CHD, MI, carotid artery disease,
kidney failure, microalbuminuria (loss of the protein, albumin, in the
urine due to kidney damage), and kidney disease. This type of
hypertension is best treated with the antihypertensive drug class called
“angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors” (ACEIs). MTHFR gene is
related to methylation and folic acid and other B vitamins and, if
defective, will cause hypertension and CHD. If you have one of these
genes then you will need to take a complex of B vitamins with methylated
folic acid. NOS 3 is an important enzyme in the production of nitric
oxide, which improves heart health and lowers blood pressure. If the NOS
3 is defective, then blood pressure increases as will the risk for CHD
and MI. A high nitrate/nitrite diet with dark green leafy vegetables,
like kale and spinach, and beets or beetroot extracts, like NEO 40, will
improve nitric oxide levels. ADR B2. The ADR B2 gene is related to how
effective the DASH diet will be in lowering blood pressure. If you have
a defect in this gene, then the DASH 2 diet results in a reflex increase
in the enzyme renin, which increases the formation of the potent
vasoconstrictor angiotensin II that increases blood pressure, CHD, and
MI. If this occurs, then you should take one of the antihypertensive
drug classes that will block the effects of renin and angiotensin II.
The drug classes are called “angiotensin receptor blockers” (ARBs) or
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). AGTR1(AT1R-AA) is
related to autoantibodies and hypertension. An “autoantibody” is an
abnormal antibody that is part of your immune system and which attacks
your own organs (i.e., attacks “the self”). This autoantibody stimulates
a receptor called angiotensin receptor I (AT1R) that causes hypertension
and increases the risk for CHD and MI. This form of hypertension is best
treated with an ARB.

implications for specific treatment of CHD and CHD risk factors. The
genetic tests listed in the (Box 9.1) define risk for CHD and CHD risk
factors. The best genetic lab test for these is Cardia-X from Vibrant
Labs America (see Sources section).

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS 1. If one of your parents had an MI at
an early age, you have a higher chance of having an MI. 2. The genetic
expression of numerous genes that cause CHD and hypertension can be
altered through nutrition, supplements, exercise, drugs, and lifestyle.
3. Evaluation of specific genetic SNPs for CHD and CHD risk factors
using the Cardia-X genetic profile from Vibrant Labs America is
recommended. 4. The traditional Mediterranean diet with five tablespoons
EVOO/day (50 grams), nuts, and CoQ10 reduces the risk for CHD. 5.
Omega-3 fatty acids should be given to all patients, dose dependent (1–5
grams per day to lower blood pressure and reduce CHD and MI risk). 6.
Avoid caffeine in CYP 1A2 SNP if a slow metabolizer of caffeine to
reduce the risk of CHD and MI. 7. Selective use of ASA and vitamin E
depending on COMT phenotype. 8. Methyl folate and B vitamins depending
on MTHFR genotype for methylation. 9. Selenium should be given with the
GSH-Px gene if defective.

12 The Importance of Nutrition Nutrition Part I

in Coronary Heart Disease Prevention and Treatment INTRODUCTION One of
the greatest causes of mortality in industrialized societies continues
to be coronary heart disease (CHD). Moreover, the ability to decrease
the incidence of CHD has reached a limit utilizing traditional
diagnostic evaluations, prevention, and treatment strategies for the top
five cardiovascular risk factors that include hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, dyslipidemia (abnormal cholesterol), obesity, and smoking. It
is well known that about 80% of CHD can be prevented with optimal
nutrition, coupled with exercise, weight management, and smoking
cessation. Among all of these factors, optimal nutrition provides the
basic foundation for prevention and treatment of CHD. Numerous nutrition
studies have shown dramatic reductions in the incidence of CHD. As
nutritional science, genetics, and nutrient gene interaction research
continues, our ability to adjust the best nutrition with an
individualized, precise, and integrated approach is emerging. This will
be a new era in personalized and precision nutrition for the prevention
and treatment of CHD. Coronary heart disease remains the number one
cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States (1, 2). The annual
cost (direct and indirect) of treating CHD is approximately \$320
billion (2). One in every three deaths is due to CHD with over 2200 US
citizens dying from CHD and myocardial infarction (MI) daily (2–5). The
top five CHD risk factors include hypertension, dyslipidemia (abnormal
cholesterol), diabetes mellitus, obesity, and smoking (1). However, more
than 400 CHD risk factors have been defined (2). There are numerous
insults to the cardiovascular system, but there are only three finite
vascular responses which include vascular inflammation, vascular
oxidative stress, and vascular immune dysfunction, which lead to plaque
formation, CHD, and MI (2–12).

NUTRITION AND CHD Targeted nutrition in combination with other lifestyle
changes is a foundational recommendation for the reduction of CHD.
National and international nutritional guidelines are still evolving as
new science, nutrition, and genetic studies (nutrigenomics)

are published. There are many recent clinical trials that provide new
information in this quest to improve CHD outcomes related to nutrition
(13–15) (Table 12.1).

Mediterranean Diet In the 4.8-year primary prevention (PREDIMED diet),
the rate of major cardiovascular events from CHD and MI, cerebrovascular
accidents (CVA), or total cardiovascular deaths were reduced by 28% with
the consumption of nuts and reduced by 30% with extra-virgin olive oil
(EVOO) (16). The reduction in MI was significant at 23% overall with a
20% reduction with EVOO and a 26% reduction from mixed nuts. Total
cardiovascular deaths were reduced by 17% (1–15). New onset type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was decreased by 40% with EVOO and 18% with
mixed nuts (17). These reductions were associated with decreases in
high-sensitivity C reactive protein (HS-CRP) and interleukin (IL-6). The
high content of nitrate (NO3) that is converted to nitrite (NO2)
(average of 400 mg per day), the increased amount of omega-3 fatty
acids, good omega-6 fatty acids, polyphenols (such as quercetin,
resveratrol, and catechins, in grapes and wine), provide many of the
beneficial outcomes in CHD (18). In large secondary prevention in
patients that had already had an MI, the Lyon Heart study (19)
demonstrated significant reductions in all events including cardiac
death, nonfatal MI, unstable angina, CVA, congestive heart failure
(CHF), and hospitalization at four years using the traditional
Mediterranean diet (TMD) supplemented with alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)
compared to a prudent Western diet. Compared to the control, the
Mediterranean style diet with ALA demonstrated a 73% lower risk of
cardiac death and nonfatal MI during the study period (19). Olive oil
was associated with a decreased risk of overall mortality and a
significant reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a
large Mediterranean study of 40,622 subjects (20). For each increase in
olive oil by 10 grams there was a 13% decrease in CV mortality. In the
highest intake of olive oil, there was a 44% decrease in CV mortality
(20). One of the mechanisms by which the TMD, particularly if
supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil at 50 grams per day, can exert
CV health benefits is through changes in the expression of
cardiovascular genes related to cardiovascular risk that include genes
for atherosclerosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular immune
dysfunction, T2DM, and hypertension(16, 17, 21–23). This includes genes
such as ADRB2 (adrenergic beta 2 receptor), IL7R (interleukin 7
receptor), IFN gamma (interferon gamma), MCP1 (monocyte chemotactic
protein), TNFα (tumor necrosis factor alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and
HS-CRP (high-sensitivity C reactive protein) (16, 17, 20–23). In
summary, the TMD has been shown to have the following effects (15–17,
21–23): • Lowers blood pressure. • Improves serum lipids: lowers total
cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG);
increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL); lowers oxidized LDL (oxLDL)
and lipoprotein a (Lp(a)). In addition, the TMD increases LDL size and
decreases the LDL particle number (LDL P) to a less atherogenic profile
that reduces the risk for CHD and MI.

The intake of potassium, magnesium, and calcium are increased but with a
variable restriction in dietary sodium (24, 25). The DASH diets
evaluated borderline or stage 1 hypertension (&lt; 160/80–95 mm Hg) in
379 subjects who were drug-free over eight weeks. A control diet was
prescribed for three weeks, and then the study subjects were randomized
to the control diet—a fruit and vegetable diet with 8.5 servings or a
combined fruit and vegetable diet with 10 servings and low-fat dairy.
The content of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fiber were the
same in the two diets. The control diet had less potassium, magnesium,
and calcium by 50%, less fiber by 22 grams, and only four servings of
fruit and vegetables but was otherwise the same as the other. Both DASH
diets reduced blood pressure within four weeks by approximately 10/5 mm
Hg. The blood pressure remained stable as long as there was good
adherence to the diets. The results on blood pressure of the various
types of DASH-I and DASH-II diets are shown below: 1. DASH-I overall
combination diet vs control diet: 5 /3 mm Hg. 2. DASH-I hypertensive
patients. Combination diet vs control diet: 10.7/5.2 mm Hg. 3. DASH-II
overall combination vs low-sodium DASH diet: 8.9/4.5 mm Hg vs control
high-sodium diet. 4. DASH-II hypertensive patients. Combination of
low-sodium DASH 11.5 /6.8 mm Hg in the diet vs high-sodium control diet.
Limiting refined carbohydrates, despite an increase in dietary saturated
fatty acids (SFA), improves the lipid profile with both of the DASH
diets. The DASH diets are as effective in BP reduction as one
antihypertensive medication and also decrease HS-CRP and serum lipids.
In the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), adherence to the DASH dietary pattern
was associated with a lower risk of CHD by 14% in those with the highest
adherence to the diet (26). The DASH diets provide various mechanisms
for the improvement of all the cardiovascular risk factors and CHD risks
including the following: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

Increased nitric oxide and increased plasma nitrate. Increased kidney
excretion of salt and water, like a diuretic. Decreased oxidative stress
and increased oxidative defense. Reduced oxidative stress. Improved
endothelial function. Decreased arterial stiffness.

DIETARY FATS Omega-3 Fatty Acids The role of fats in CHD has been
evaluated in numerous clinical trials (14, 27–71). A large study of over
830,000 patients taking omega-3 FA (30) examined EPA+DHA
(eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) from foods or
supplements and

Monounsaturated Fats The effects of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)
on the risk of CHD, CHD mortality, serum lipids, and endothelial
vascular function are favorable (49, 72, 73). Partial replacement of SFA
with MUFA improves the blood lipids and reduces the risk of CHD (49, 73,
74). The Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up
Study (HPFS) followed over 84,000 patients for 24–30 years (51).
Replacing 5% of energy from SFA with equivalent energy intake from MUFA
was associated with a 15% lower risk of CHD. In the 4.8-year primary
prevention (PREDIMED diet), the rate of major cardiovascular events from
myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, and total CV deaths
were reduced by 28% with mixed nuts and 30% with extra-virgin olive oil
(16).

Saturated Fatty Acids Clinical studies offer conflicting conclusions
regarding the role of SFA in the risk of CHD. This has led to confusion
in the lay public that is exacerbated by recently published national
best sellers and different nutrition recommendations by national and
international committees (14, 18, 27, 28, 31–56). The source of the
confusion lies

.d o

m

C w

the relationship to CHD, MI, sudden cardiac death, coronary death, and
angina in primary and secondary prevention. There was a 6% reduction in
CHD risk with EPA+DHA. However, in those with high triglycerides over
150 mg/dL, and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol above 130
mg/dL, there was a statistically significant 14–16% CHD risk reduction
with EPA+DHA. Other studies resulted a 18% significant reduction of CHD
for higher intakes of EPA+DHA over one gram per day. The sudden cardiac
death (SCD) rate was reduced 47%. The greatest reduction in CHD (25%)
occurred in those with high TG over 150 mg/dL and doses of omega-3 FA
over one gram per day. These results and others indicate that EPA+DHA
may be associated with a reduction in CHD risk, with the greatest
benefit observed among higher-risk populations and those taking higher
doses of EPA+DHA. Omega-3 FAs reduce ventricular arrhythmias (57) and
decrease cardiovascular and total mortality (58). Omega-3 FAs are
typically found in coldwater fish, such as salmon, mackerel, and others
as well as plant-based products, like algae, flax, chia, and hemp seeds;
as fatty fish eat algae, they serve as a supply for these essential
fats. Omega-3 fatty acids decrease MI and CHD 18% more with concomitant
use of statins (61), reduce stent restenosis, (59), reduce post MI
mortality (62), coronary artery bypass graft occlusion (CABG occlusion)
(63, 64), plaque formation, coronary artery calcification, and
atherosclerosis (65, 66); improve the lipid profile (10, 67); lower
glucose and improve insulin resistance (68–70); and reduce blood
pressure (2, 4, 11, 71). The dose prescribed will depend on the
condition being treated as well as age, body weight, and use of
concomitant medications and other nutritional supplements. It is best to
use a balanced formulation with DHA, EPA, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and
gamma-delta tocopherols. This will prevent oxidation in the cell
membranes and reduce depletions of the EPA and DHA by GLA or vice versa
(10, 67, 71).

Conclusions and Summary on SFAs SFA are diverse compounds and cannot be
“lumped” into a single category, as they have variable effects on CHD.
It is prudent to replace long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) with PUFA, MUFA,
short chain fatty acids (SCFA), whole grains, plant proteins, and,
perhaps, medium chain fatty acids (MCFA). The daily recommended grams
per day or percent of SFA relative to total fat or total calories cannot
be accurately

within the complexity, accuracy, and coordination of the results and
conclusions in basic science, clinical epidemiology, and clinical
studies. Some of the misconceptions and improper interpretations are
related to the source of the SFA, its chemical structure (such as the
carbon length, absorption, and the replacement nutrient(s)), how our
genes respond to dietary SFAs, and the composition of the gut microbiome
(31–35). SFAs also have variable effects on blood lipids, fatty liver
disease, thrombosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune vascular
function (31–41). Stearate is a long-chain fatty acid that has a carbon
length of 18 (C-18) and has minimal effect on CHD risk or serum lipids
due to its rapid change to MUFA by an enzyme (31–33). Long-chain fatty
acids (LCFA) enhance gastrointestinal growth of gram-negative bacteria
and their cell walls, inducing inflammation, increasing gastrointestinal
permeability and the risk of endotoxemia (31, 36–40). Published clinical
trials and reviews have provided more accurate insights into the
relationship of SFA and CHD (27, 28, 42–49). The largest meta-analysis
of three large studies (Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS), the
Nurses’ Health Study (NHS 1), and the NHS-2), utilizing a 5% equal
energy replacement in calories (isocaloric energy replacement) of SFA
with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, or vegetable fat), was
associated with a 24% and 10% reduction in CHD risk, respectively (43).
Replacement of 1% of energy from SFAs with PUFAs lowers LDL cholesterol,
which predicts a 2–8% reduction in CHD (43). SFA intake and CHD were
positively associated in the prospective, longitudinal cohort studies of
over 115,000 men and women in the HPFS and the NHS over a 34–38-year
follow-up (44). SFAs were mostly lauric acid (12:0), myristic acid
(14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), and stearic acid (18:0) at 9–11.3% of
energy intake. Comparing the highest versus the lowest groups of
individual SFA intakes, CHD increased 7% for 12:0, 13% for 14:0, 18% for
16:0, 18% for 18:0, and 18% for all four SFAs combined. The reduction in
CHD after 1% energy isocaloric replacement of SFA 12:0–18:0 was 8% for
PUFA, 5% for MUFA, 6% for whole grains and 7% for plant proteins (45).
The PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) was a six-year
prospective study of 7038 subjects with a high CVD risk that included
CHD, MI, CVA, or death from CV causes (28). The dietary consumption of
saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans fatty acid (TFA) from the highest
to the lowest daily intake increased overall CVD by 81% and 67%,
respectively. The intake of PUFAs and MUFAs reduced the risk of CVD and
death. The isocaloric replacement of SFAs or TFA with MUFAs and PUFAs
reduced CHD (28). SFA from processed foods increased CHD (28).

determined at this time. Some studies suggest that the SFA dietary
intake should be well below 9% of the total caloric intake. The overall
relationship of the human diet to CHD should include the totality of our
nutrition and avoid reductionist evaluations of single macronutrients.
New nutritional guidelines should promote dietary patterns that improve
CHD based on validated science. Refined carbohydrates, high fructose
corn syrup, starches, and TFA increase the risk of CHD. Omega-6 FAs
appear to be neutral or improve CHD risk, whereas omega-3 Fas, PUFAs,
MUFAs, fermented foods, fiber, fruits and vegetables, and the PREDIMED
diet reduce CHD and CVD (14, 31–56).

SATURATED FATTY ACID KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS AND CONCLUSIONS 1. Dietary SFA
intake is associated with an increased CHD risk, and reducing dietary
SFA through isocaloric (ISC) replacement with PUFA, MUFA, omega-6 FA,
whole grains, and plant proteins decreases CHD risk. 2. The source of
the SFA is associated with the risk for CHD. Dietary intake of meat and
animal fat have the greatest risk with a range of 6–48%. 3. LCFA are the
most likely SFA associated with CHD risk. SCFA are not associated with
CHD risk, but additional studies are needed to confirm this. 4. The
carbon chain number of the SFA may be associated with CHD risk. 5.
Replacement of SFA with PUFA reduces CHD risk. 6. Replacement of SFA
with MUFA reduces CHD risk 7. Replacement of SFA with omega-6 FAs
decreases CHD risk. 8. Replacement of SFA with refined carbohydrates
(CHO) increases CHD risk.

Trans Fatty Acids A study of 126,233 participants from the NHS and the
HPFS analyzed the relationship between choices of dietary fats and
overall mortality (75). During the followup, 33,304 deaths were
documented. Dietary TFA had the most significant adverse impact on
health. Every 2% higher intake of TFA was associated with a 16% higher
chance of premature death and a 25% increase in CHD death and nonfatal
MI during the study period (75). The overall recommendations were to
reduce omega-6 fatty acids, increase omega-3 fatty acids and the ratio
of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids and reduce SFA in addition to the
elimination of TFA. The cardiovascular adverse effects of industrially
produced TFAs are shown below (14, 76, 77,78). 1. Dyslipidemia. A.
Increases total cholesterol— 8%. B. Increases LDL-C— 9%. C. Increases
TG— 9%. D. Lowers HDL-C 2—3%.

Coconut Oil Coconut oil has been inappropriately promoted for a
reduction in CHD and other CV events with no evidence to support it in
human clinical studies. In a meta-analysis of 21 studies with 8 clinical
trials and 13 observational studies, coconut oil increased TC and LDL
more than PUFA but less than butter, and it increased HDL and TG with no
change in TC/HDL ratio. There was no change in any cardiovascular or CHD
events (79, 80). Coconut oil is 92% SFA, mostly lauric acid C 12:0 up to
51% (MCFA), then myristic acid (C14:0), and palmitic (C-16). SFA with a
carbon length over 12 are considered LCFA, which may increase LDL and
CHD risk. Coconut oil should not be recommended at this time for
prevention or treatment of CHD or CVD due to the lack of prospective
studies on CV outcomes and the mixed effects on serum lipids. It would
seem based on the percentage of SFA types that it may be neutral in the
effects on CHD and lipids. See below for the types of fats in coconut
oil.​

Milk, Milk Products, and Peptides Recent clinical studies indicate that
milk, milk peptides, and milk products reduce blood pressure, CHD, DM,
CVA, and atherosclerosis (81–83). In a recent metaanalysis of 27 studies
there was an inverse association between total dairy intake and
cardiovascular disease. Milk and milk products improve insulin
resistance, postprandial hyperglycemia, lower blood pressure, increase
nitric oxide, improve endothelial function, and decrease inflammation
and oxidative stress (81, 83). All of these effects may reduce the risk
of CHD (81–83). Milk proteins, both caseins and whey proteins are rich
sources of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides that
significantly reduce blood pressure (81–83). Although milk products
appear innocuous, they are pro-inflammatory for some individuals;
caution is advised, especially for intolerant subjects.

Whey Protein Several studies show that chronic intake of several grams
(typically 20 grams) of whey protein significantly reduces blood
pressure (84–87), decreases TG and cholesterol levels (88), increases
intracellular glutathione levels, and lowers inflammation in patients
with cardiovascular disease (85, 89). These benefits may come from
chronic consumption rather than a single dose (90). The type of whey
protein may impact results. Clinical trial data indicate that whey
protein must be hydrolyzed to ACE inhibitor peptides for it to have
antihypertensive properties (84–86, 91, 92). In addition, certain whey
protein preparations may result in a relatively higher insulin response
relative to other protein sources (93, 94), which may or may not be
beneficial in some patient populations. Eggs The effect of eggs on serum
cholesterol and CHD risk has been a contentious argument over the past
few decades, but recent studies have provided scientific guidance. A
retrospective review of 17 studies with 556 subjects found that for each
100 mg of dietary cholesterol per day in eggs, the total cholesterol
(TC) increased 2.2 mg/ dL, low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) increased 1.9
mg/dL, high-density cholesterol (HDL-C) increased 0.3 mg/dL, and the
TC/HDL ratio increased 0.2 units (95). A 50-gram egg contains about 200
mg of cholesterol, 6 grams of protein, and 5 grams of fat (36% SFA, 48%
MUFA, and 16% PUFA) (95). Subjects with metabolic syndrome or type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) consuming three whole eggs per day on a
carbohydrate-restricted diet of less than 30% energy, compared to an egg
substitute, had reductions in tumor necrosis alpha (TNF alpha) and
triglycerides (TG), increases in HDL-C—with no change in TC, LDL, or
other inflammatory markers—and a lower risk of T2DM or its progression
(96, 97). In the HPFS and NHS studies, with almost 18,000 subjects
followed for 8–14 years, there was no evidence of any significant
association between egg consumption and risk for CHD with

REFINED CARBOHYDRATES, SUGARS, AND SUGAR SUBSTITUTES Refined
carbohydrates are associated with an increased risk of CHD in all
studies (31, 32, 51, 102). Sugars, refined carbohydrates, high fructose
corn syrup (HFCS) and starches confer significant risk for dyslipidemia,
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and CHD compared to omega-3 FA,
MUFA, fermented foods, fiber, fruits and vegetables, dairy, and the TMD
and DASH 2 diets (103). A prospective study of 117,366 subjects without
history of diabetes, CHD, or stroke examined intakes of carbohydrates
and grains in relation to CHD using food-frequency questionnaires over
7.6 years (102). Carbohydrate intake accounted for about 68% of the
total energy intake. Carbohydrate intake and CHD were highly associated
with an increased risk of CHD by 80%. In the NHS and HPFS, carbohydrates
from refined starches and added sugars increased the risk of CHD by ten
percent (51). In a study of 39,786 subjects, daily diet soft drink
consumption increased the risk of total CVA by 21% and the risk of all
vascular events by 43%, which includes ischemic CVA, CHD, MI, and
vascular death (104). The Japan Public Health Center study showed both
sugar-sweetened and low-calorie sodas significantly increased the risk
of stroke by 16% per one serving daily and CHD by 20% per one serving
daily (105). Sugar substitutes increase the risk for obesity, weight
gain, metabolic syndrome, T2DM, and CHD. Sugar substitutes interfere
with learned responses that normally regulate consumption of food, have
an adverse effect on the microbiome, and alter leptin levels, which
increases obesity and decreases satiety (106, 107).

the possible exception of T2DM (98). However, in another study, egg
consumption was not associated with any cardiovascular outcome in
individuals with T2DM either (99). In a prospective study over 13 years
of 37,766 men and 32,805 women who were free of CVD, egg consumption was
assessed at baseline with a food-frequency questionnaire (99. There was
no statistically significant association between egg consumption and
risk of MI in either men or women. In the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease
Risk Factor Study of 1032 men, egg or cholesterol intakes were not
associated with increased CHD risk, even in ApoE4 carriers (100). A
meta-analysis, including 90,735 participants and a follow-up time from
5.8 to 20.0 years, evaluated the role of egg consumption on CHD risk
(101). Comparison of the highest category (≥1 egg/d) of egg consumption
with the lowest (&lt;1 egg/week or none) showed no change in the risk of
CHD and MI based on the number of eggs eaten per day or week. This
meta-analysis suggests that egg consumption is not associated with the
risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiac mortality in the general
population. The results from many nutrition trials suggest that
consumption of 6 to 12 eggs per week, in the context of a diet that is
consistent with guidelines on cardiovascular health promotion, has no
adverse effect on major CHD risk factors in individuals at risk for
developing diabetes or in those with T2DM.

PROTEIN Vegetarian Diets and Plant-Based Nutrition Vegetarian diets
significantly reduce CVD, CHD, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score
that is proportional to the dietary intake of vegetables (32, 103–115).
In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
(EIPC) study of 44,561 subjects in England and Scotland followed for
11.6 years, the body mass index (BMI), lipids, and blood pressure were
all reduced in the vegetarian group and there was a 32% lower incidence
of CHD (112). A study of 96,469 Seventh–Day Adventist men and women from
2002 to 2007 demonstrated a 12% decrease in total mortality, 15% in
vegans, 9% in lacto-ovo vegetarians, 19% in pesco-vegetarian and 8% in
semi-vegetarians, which was primarily related to decreases in CVD (113).
The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is also reduced with chronic
dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (114). A meta-analysis of nine
studies of 222,081 men and women found the overall reduction in CHD risk
was 4% for each additional portion of fruit and vegetable intake per day
and 7% for each additional serving of fruit (115). Dark green leafy
vegetables had the most dramatic reduction in CHD risk. In a
meta-analysis of 95 studies, for fruits and vegetables combined per 200
grams/day, there was an 8% decrease in CHD. Similar associations were
observed for fruits and vegetables separately. Reductions in risk were
observed for up to 800 grams/day for CHD with the intake of apples and
pears, citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables,
and salads (116). Some vegetarian diets may be deficient in many
nutrients which require supplemental B12, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty
acids, iron, calcium, carnitine, zinc, and some highquality amino acids
and protein (117). Other studies suggest several other problems, such as
decreased sulfur amino acid intake with a low elemental sulfur,
increased homocysteine, and oxidative stress. In addition, lean muscle
mass was 10% lower and there may be an increased risk of subclinical
malnutrition and CVD (117).

Animal Protein Diets Recent studies show either no correlation or an
inverse correlation of grassfed beef, wild game, organically fed
animals, and other sources of protein with

inflammatory compounds known to play a role in the pathogenesis of
chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and CHD. They are
formed when some sugar, proteins, and lipids come together in the
presence of heat. Several modern cooking methods, including industrial
heat processing, grilling, broiling, roasting, searing, and frying,
significantly increase dietary AGE formation and exposure (108). A
lowAGE diet may decrease circulating blood AGE levels, improve
endothelial function, lower inflammatory mediators, and reduce
atherosclerosis development (109–111). Dietary intake of AGEs can be
reduced by avoiding foods known to be high in AGEs such as full-fat
cheeses, meats, and highly processed foods, while increasing the
consumption of fish, grains, low-fat milk products, fruits, and
vegetables. Boiling, poaching, and stewing as well as steaming and
slower cooking at a lower heat can reduce dietary AGE exposure (108).

Soy Protein There has been debate about the inclusion of soy protein in
the diet and CHD (124–126). Most likely, the variability in results may
also be due to the different types of available soy products and their
degree of processing, resulting in a variety of byproducts formed, such
as fermentation complexes. Thus, not all soy is equal, and the more
processed it is, the more it should be avoided. Organic tofu, tempeh,
miso, and edamame are important sources of soy protein that one may
consider.

Fish Studies largely support fish consumption for cardiovascular health
(127–140). Eating fish one to two times weekly, especially higher
omega-3 fatty acid-containing fish, reduces risk of CHD by 36% and total
mortality by 17%. You should eat a variety of seafood with limited
intake of high mercury-containing fish but with greater fish consumption
(≥ five servings/week). Fish intake reduces the risk of congestive heart
failure by 6% for each 20 grams of daily fish. Active ingredients in
bonito and other coldwater fish may contribute to its cardioprotective
qualities, such as the presence of ACE inhibitory peptides (133–135).
Intake of sardine muscle protein by mildly hypertensive volunteers led
to 9.7/5.3 mm Hg reduction in blood pressure in one week (136). It is
important to consider the type of fish and their relative methylmercury
levels as well as the degree to which individuals can transport mercury
based on their genetics (137). Methylmercury has detrimental effects
that increase the risk of CHD, MI, and hypertension (138–140). Thus,
larger fish, such as tilefish, shark, swordfish, large grouper, and tuna
may contain higher mercury levels; caution and even omission are
advised. However, the benefits of smaller fish consumption likely
outweigh the risks from the potential toxins it contains (128).

DIETARY ACID LOAD AND PROTEIN Diet-induced ‘low-grade’ metabolic
acidosis is thought to play an important role in the development of
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity (141,
142). Vegetables, fruits, and some beverages (red wine and coffee) are

.d o

m

C w

CHD (118–123). The Paleolithic diet has also shown reductions in total
mortality of 23% and CV mortality of 22% in a study of 21,423 subjects
(118). All meat (including red meat, fish, seafood, poultry) had an
inverse relationship to CVD mortality in men in Asian countries (120).
Another meta-analysis showed no association between red meat consumption
and CHD but found that processed red meat increased risk of
hypertension, total mortality, CHD, and T2DM risk (118–123). A recently
published study of over a half a million subjects answering food
questionnaires that were followed for 16 years did identify a
significant association between all forms of red meat consumption,
all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. In the Beef in an Optimal Lean
Diet (BOLD) study trial, a low dietary SFA intake heart healthy diet
containing lean beef elicits a favorable effect on CHD and blood lipids
that are comparable to the DASH diet (119).

considered alkaline, while fats and oils are neutral. Meats, especially
red meat. has a high acid load, and dairy products and cereal grains are
acid-producing (141, 142). Dietary acid load can be improved by
increasing intake of fruits and vegetables and decreasing excessively
high dietary animal protein intake (143). A ten-day intervention with an
alkaline Paleolithic-style diet led to a marked increase in potassium
levels and improvements in vascular reactivity, blood pressure, glucose
levels, insulin sensitivity, and lipid levels (143). While the
definitive effects of dietary acid load on cardiovascular health are not
yet clear, it is apparent that such dietary changes are in line with
DASH and the TMD.

SPECIFIC DIETARY AND NUTRITIONAL COMPONENTS AND CALORIC RESTRICTION
Several dietary and nutritional components have been shown to decrease
inflammation by interrupting the inflammatory vascular receptors (8).
These include the following: • • • • • • •

Curcumin (turmeric). Cinnamaldehyde (cinnamon). Sulforaphane (broccoli).
Resveratrol (nutritional supplement, red wine, grapes). Epigallocatechin
gallate (EGCG) (green tea). Luteolin (celery, green pepper, rosemary,
carrots, oregano, oranges, olives). Quercetin (tea, apples, onion,
tomatoes, capers).

These interactions between food groups or supplements with the vascular
membrane receptors may initiate improved vascular responses, decreased
vascular inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular immune responses
that reduce CHD risk. A prospective study of 42 subjects over two years
showed a significant reduction in the progression of CHD as assessed by
coronary artery calcium (CAC) compared to historical controls using a
phytonutrient concentrate containing a high content of fruit and
vegetable extracts. The change in the CAC score was significantly less
in the treated patients vs the control patients (19.6% vs 34.7% increase
respectively, a 15.1% difference) (144).

Caffeine The cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 genotype modifies the association
between caffeinated coffee intake and the risk of hypertension, CVD,
CHD, and MI in a linear relationship (145–152). Caffeine is exclusively
metabolized by CYP1A2 (145). Caffeine also blocks vasodilating adenosine
receptors (152). The rapid metabolizers of caffeinated coffee IA/IA
allele have average BP reduction of 10/7 mm Hg and reduced risk of MI by
17–52% (150). This SNP represents about 40–45% of the population
(145–150). The slow metabolizers of caffeine IF/IF or IA/IF allele have
higher BP of 8.1/5.7 mm Hg lasting &gt; three hours after consumption,
tachycardia, increased risk

Caloric Restriction Caloric restriction refers to a reduction of energy
intake at the individualized level that is sufficient to maintain a
slightly low to normal body weight (i.e., body mass index of about 21
kg/m2) without causing malnutrition (153). Findings from longterm
calorie restriction of 40% in animal models have revealed improvements
in metabolic health, offsetting chronic disease, and, consequently,
extending life span (154). Animal studies, including the rhesus monkey,
on caloric restriction, have identified cardiovascular benefits
including reductions in oxidative stress and inflammation in the heart
and vasculature, beneficial effects on endothelial function and arterial
stiffness, and protection against atherosclerosis and less detrimental
agerelated changes in the heart (155). Limited evidence from human data
suggests some of these effects translate to human caloric restriction
(156). Alternate-day (ADF) or intermittent fasting is another similar
approach with cardiovascular benefit. Typically, ADF involves consuming
25% of energy needs on the fast day and ad libitum food intake on the
following day (157). Results indicate weight loss and improvements in
cardiometabolic health, such as reductions in aortic vascular stiffness,
C reactive protein, adiponectin, leptin, total cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, triglyceride concentration, and systolic blood pressure
(158). Caloric restriction could be implemented by constructing a
personalized diet based on nutrient-dense, low-energy foods such as
vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, fish, low-fat dairy products,
and lean meats (159). Another type of fast would be to avoid eating for
12–14 hours overnight. You can also reduce the daily intake of calories
by 20% and exercise daily to consume another 20% of calories.

Alcohol The connection between alcohol consumption and CHD is based on a
U-shaped curve, such that overconsumption or under-consumption is not as
likely to reduce CHD as the base of the U-shaped curve which is
associated with the lowest risk of CHD (160–162). An alcoholic drink in
most research studies is 14 grams of ethanol or 0.6 fluid ounces of pure
alcohol. This equates to a 12-ounce beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or
1.5 ounces of hard liquor (160). “Light to moderate” drinking (defined
as one drink a day for women, two drinks a day for men) is associated
with lower rates of total mortality, CHD morbidity, diabetes mellitus,
heart failure, and strokes, especially in people over 50 years of age
(160–162). This was confirmed in an analysis of studies combining data
on over 1 million people and overall death rates where

of MI, increased aortic stiffness, higher pulse wave velocity, vascular
inflammation, and increased catecholamines (145–150). Based on age and
consumption, the risk of MI will vary. At age 59 there was a 36%
increase in MI with two to three cups/day and a 64% increase with four
cups/day or more. Under the age of 59, MI increased by 24% (one
cup/day), 67% (two cups/day) and 233% (four or more cups/day) (150,
151). This SNP represents about 55–60% of the population. If you are a
slow metabolizer of caffeine, then you should completely eliminate it
from your diet from all sources.

Gluten About 1% of the public has celiac disease and perhaps another
6–7% have verified gluten sensitivity with dramatic changes in the
appearance of their gastrointestinal tract when it is consumed on a
regular basis (163). A key consequence of the damage to the intestinal
wall lining is that the normally tight junctions that bind cells lining
the gastrointestinal (GI) tract become loose. When these junctions are
loose, the contents of the GI tract can enter the wall of the bowels and
then enter into the bloodstream. Many studies have shown that, after a
fatty meal, a wave of inflammation and endotoxins enter the bloodstream
and may remain present for hours (6, 9, 10). When gliadin, a component
of gluten-containing foods like bread, is present in the intestines of
those with celiac or gluten sensitivity, a newly discovered protein
called zonulin is released into the gut (163). Zonulin is now thought to
have a potential role not only in celiac disease but also Type 1
diabetes, obesity, and other immune illnesses (163). It has been shown
to be the “crowbar” that opens tight junctions and leads to autoimmune
responses, such as a leaky GI tract (163). The ability to measure blood
levels of zonulin may revolutionize our understanding of GI, autoimmune,
and other systemic diseases. There are little data linking gluten and
CHD. In an analysis of patients who had suffered an MI in Sweden, those
with celiac disease had similar outcomes to those without celiac disease
(164). There are case reports of cardiomyopathy being associated with
gluten sensitivities that respond to the withdrawal of foods (165). In
another case report, a review of gluten antibodies and proven celiac
disease was reported in nine additional cases of cardiomyopathy (166).
Generally, 100% whole grains, as opposed to processed white flour-based
foods, are to be encouraged for patients with CHD. A meta-analysis that
examined whole grain consumption and the risk of developing CHD and MI
in more than 400,000 participants found that the highest consumption of
whole grains reduced the risk by about 25% (167). The authors indicated
that whole grain foods contain fiber, vitamins, minerals,
phytoestrogens, phenolic compounds, and have a favorable effect on
measures of cholesterol, blood glucose, inflammation, and arterial
function. In a 26-year follow-up of 64, 714 women in the NHS and 45, 303
men in the HPFS, dietary gluten intake was not associated with risk of
CHD (fatal or nonfatal MI) (168).

Nuts Nuts are high in MUFA and PUFA but may also contain some omega-6
FA. The beneficial effects of nut consumption on cardiovascular disease,
CV deaths, CHD, and

the U-shaped curve was best at one to two drinks per day for women and
two to four drinks per day for men (161). Red wine in particular is rich
in polyphenols, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet
actions (160, 161). In a recent review and meta-analysis of alcohol
consumption and cardiovascular disease, light to moderate alcohol
consumption (162), reduced the risk for CHD by 29%, and all-cause
mortality was reduced by 13%. Pinot noir is generally credited with
having the highest concentration of the potent polyphenol resveratrol in
the grape (160–162).

Dietary Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium Increased dietary sodium is
associated with an increased risk of hypertension, CHD, MI, CHF, CVA,
renal insufficiency, and proteinuria (175–179). Approximately 75 million
people in the United States and up to 1 billion worldwide have been
diagnosed with hypertension (175–179). Up to 50% of cardiovascular
related deaths result from hypertension. The sodium–potassium ratio may
be more important that the actual dietary sodium and potassium intake
and the risk of CHD (175). A number of population studies demonstrating
that higher dietary potassium, as rated by urinary excretion or dietary
recall, was generally associated with lower blood pressure and CHD
regardless of the level of sodium intake (175–180). According to a
report of the Institute of Medicine, adult recommendations are to
consume at least 4.7 grams of potassium daily to control blood pressure
and reduce dietary sodium intake to about 1.5 to 2 grams per day (2, 4,
175–179). The potassium/sodium ratio should be greater than 2.5 to 3.0
(2, 4, 175–179). Foods that are high in potassium include bran,
mushrooms, macadamia nuts and almonds, dark leafy greens, avocados,
apricots, fruits, and acorn squash. The role of dietary magnesium in
cardiovascular health is important and supported by many studies. It is
estimated that nearly half the US population consumes less than the
recommended amount of magnesium in their diets, and magnesium deficiency
is a commonly overlooked risk factor for cardiovascular disease (177).
The lower the dietary intake of magnesium, the greater the risk of
succumbing to cardiovascular disease. Magnesium supplementation can be
therapeutic for a range of cardiovascular issues including arrhythmias,
hypertension, atherosclerosis, and endothelial dysfunction. Magnesium is
critical for tissues that have electrical or mechanical activity, such
as nerves, muscles (including the heart), and blood vessels (177). In a
six-month study of patients with known CHD, magnesium supplementation

MI was well documented in the PREDIMED trial with a reduction in total
CV death of 28% with nut consumption (15–18). In the Adventist Health
Study, which examined obesity and metabolic syndrome in more than 800
people, there was a strong inverse relationship between tree nut
consumption and developing both medical conditions (169). Other studies
suggest that eating tree nuts does not lead to weight gain, and the high
concentration of fiber and nutrients offsets the calories consumed. Nuts
may reduce CHD deaths and all-cause mortality as well (15–18, 170). In a
larger analysis of the Adventist Health Study examining death in
residents over age 84 and consuming nuts &gt;5 times a week, there was a
20% reduction in total mortality and a 40% reduction in CHD mortality
(170). The impact of including nuts in the diet has been analyzed in a
recent large meta-analysis (171). The habit of eating 28 grams of
nuts/day reduced the risk for CHD by 29%. It was estimated that 4
million deaths a year could be avoided worldwide by eating a handful of
nuts daily (172). In a study of 40 subjects comparing a walnut-enriched
diet to a control diet over eight weeks, the walnut diet reduced total
cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, which is the carrier in the blood for
LDL cholesterol (173). Walnuts also significantly improve endothelial
function (174).

led to an impressive decrease in angina attacks and a decrease in the
use of antianginal drugs, such as nitroglycerin, by improving
endothelial function (178).

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS 1. The role of nutrition in the
prevention and treatment of CHD has been clearly demonstrated in
published clinical trials. 2. The top five cardiovascular risk factors,
as presently defined, are not an adequate explanation for the current
limitations to prevent and to reduce CHD. 3. Proper definition and
analysis of the top five CV risk factors, evaluation of the three finite
responses, and sound nutritional advice and evaluation based on
scientific studies will be required to affect an improvement in risk for
CHD. 4. Early detection of CHD coupled with aggressive prevention and
treatment of all cardiovascular risk factors will diminish the
progression of functional and structural cardiovascular abnormalities
and clinical CHD. 5. Utilization of targeted personalized and precision
treatments that apply genetics with optimal nutrition coupled with
exercise, ideal weight and body composition, and discontinuation of all
tobacco use can prevent approximately 80% of CHD. 6. Nutritional studies
provide evidence that CHD can be reduced with a weighted plant-based
diet with ten servings of fruits and vegetables per day, MUFA, PUFA,
nuts, whole grains, coldwater fish, the DASH diets, PREDIMED-TMD diet;
and reduction of refined carbohydrates and sugars, sucrose, sugar
substitutes, high fructose corn syrup, long-chain SFAs, processed foods,
and elimination of all TFA (Table 12.1). 7. Eggs and dairy products are
not associated with CHD. 8. Coconut oil is neutral for CHD risk. 9.
Organic grass-fed beef and wild game may reduce CHD. 10. High intakes of
potassium and magnesium are recommended in conjunction with sodium
restriction. 11. Caffeine intake should be adjusted depending on the
genetic ability to metabolize it via the CYP 1A2 system. 12. Alcohol is
associated with a U-shaped curve and CHD. 13. The roles of gluten, soy,
and caloric restriction regarding CHD in humans require further study.

13 The Practice of Nutrition Nutrition Part II

in Your Daily Life to Prevent and Treat CHD Now that we have looked at
an overview of all the clinical nutrition studies that demonstrate how
to prevent and treat CHD, let’s look at how these nutrition programs
work in real terms of your daily life so that you can practice them. By
addressing everything, from rituals to recipes, I will provide you with
a truly comprehensive way to reframe and rethink your relationship to
food, health, wellness, and CHD prevention and treatment. I want to
thank Lee Bell NC, BCHN, my nutritionist in the Hypertension Institute,
for her assistance with this chapter. Types of Food that You Should
Avoid 1. The “big four” foods to avoid: a. Unfamiliar. b.
Unpronounceable. c. More than five ingredients. d. Includes high
fructose corn syrup. 2. Don't eat anything your great-grandmother
wouldn't recognize as food. 3. Avoid food products that make health
claims. 4. Don't eat anything incapable of rotting. 5. Shop the outer
aisles of the supermarket, and stay out of the middle aisles. 6. Get out
of the supermarket and into the farmer’s market whenever possible. 7.
Eat mostly plants, especially leaves. 8. You are what you eat. 9. Eat
well-grown food from healthy soils. 10. Eat wild foods when you can. 11.
Regard nontraditional foods with skepticism. 12. Don't look for a “magic
bullet” in the traditional diet. 13. Eat meals—not snacks. 14. Pay more,
eat less. 15. Do all your eating at a table. 16. Don’t get your fuel
from the same place your car does. 17. Try not to eat alone, and eat
slowly. 18. Cook your own meals and, if you can, plant a garden.

A Word about Sodium • When dining out, ask for information on calories,
fat, and sodium. Many chains offer nutritional profiles of their menu
options online. • When possible, ask for meals to be prepared without
salt, then add a pinch or two. • At the market, read nutrition labels
and don’t buy foods that include a lot of sodium. Processed foods with
high sodium tend to be breads, cold cuts, cured meats, frozen meals, and
packaged soups. Better yet, remember real food doesn’t have a label. So,
opt for fresh food, which is typically found on the perimeter of the
store. Focus less on foods that come in a box, bag, or can. • Cook at
home more and base those meals on fresh and whole foods, not highly
processed, heat-and-serve products that tend to be high in sodium. •
Keep portions in check. To attract customers, most restaurants serve
portions that are 2–3 times larger than sensible dietary guidelines
recommend. • Instead of prepackaged snack foods, opt for these low
sodium snacks: • Organic, air-popped popcorn. • Low glycemic fruit such
as berries. • Sprouted or raw, unsalted nuts. • Steamed edamame. •
Homemade kale chips. • Homemade roasted chickpeas. • Homemade sweet
potato chips. • Guacamole. • Protein smoothie. • Vegetables: baby
carrots, celery sticks, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, red and green
peppers, steamed broccoli, cauliflower florets. • Coconut milk yogurt
with berries (freeze yogurt and blend with berries). Food prepared with
little or no salt should still be delicious and flavorful. Try to load
up on fresh herbs and spices such as cumin, paprika, oregano, lemon
peel, garlic, onion powder, and rubbed sage to season food. Vinegars,
citrus juices, and zests are good, too. I am not a fan of salt
substitutes or ‘lite salt’, as most of them contain potassium chloride.
While these have no sodium, they may cause the body to retain potassium.
And remember, most of the foods we eat regularly today are not the
normal foods of our species. Instead, they’re foods that have been
created to elicit an unnatural, elevated taste response; as a result,
these foods are high in processed sugar, fat, and salt. Our taste buds
and the pleasure centers in our brain find these unnatural foods very
appealing, making whole natural foods less palatable by comparison. But
don’t despair: “neuroadaptation” is a normalizing process, whereby the
taste buds will change once you adjust your diet to whole foods. Based
on the patient’s need, I recommend somewhere between 1500 and 2000 mg of
sodium a day for those with cardiovascular disease or high blood
pressure. This

is the equivalent to about 3/4 teaspoon of table salt. (Note that the
average American takes in over 5000 mg of sodium per day.)

RECIPES 1. Crispy Cauliflower with Gremolata 1 head cauliflower,
quartered, cored, and cut into bite-size florets 3 to 4 tablespoons
extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling Salt and freshly
cracked pepper 1 lemon 1 large handful of fresh parsley (about 1/2
cup/25 g), roughly chopped Sea salt, for serving Preheat the oven to
425°F (220°C). Spread the cauliflower on a baking sheet in a single
layer. Drizzle with the oil, season generously with salt and pepper, and
toss to coat. Roast the cauliflower, tossing the florets halfway
through, until they are deep golden and crispy, 30 to 35 minutes total.
While the cauliflower is roasting, prepare gremolata. Transfer the
roasted cauliflower to a serving bowl and mix with gremolata to taste.
For some it’s a couple tablespoons, for others they like more sauce!!!
Gremolata (Italian herb sauce) 1 cup packed Italian parsley (small stems
are okay) 1–2 garlic cloves Zest of one small lemon, plus 1–2 teaspoons
lemon juice (Meyer lemon is especially nice) ½ cup olive oil ⅛ teaspoon
kosher salt and pepper, to taste Pinch chili flakes (optional) On a
cutting board or mat, chop everything very finely and place it into a
bowl. Stir in olive oil, salt, and pepper. Add chili flakes for a touch
of heat if you like. Store in a jar in the fridge for up to one week. An
excellent sauce for eggs, fish, or chicken! 2. Avocado Egg “Toast” 1/4
medium avocado 1/2 clove garlic, mashed 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper 1
slice sweet potato toast 1 large egg, poached 1 teaspoon store-bought
hot sauce (optional) 1 tablespoon sliced red onion Combine avocado,
pepper, garlic, and hot sauce. Top sweet potato toast with mashed
avocado and poached egg. Garnish with red onions. 3. Salmon with Fresh

SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND TAKE-AWAY POINTS Eating a heart-healthy diet
is easy, tastes good, and can prevent CHD. • Vegetables: eat 8 to 12
servings per day of non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli,
cauliflower, leafy greens, asparagus. • Fruit: limit to four servings. ½
cup of pieces = one serving. One small whole fruit = one serving. •
Fats: eat good fats and avoid some saturated fats and all trans fats.
Omega-3 fatty acids (1–2 grams per day) Extra virgin olive oil (4
tablespoons per day), and olive products. • Protein: 25–30%
clean-sourced fish, turkey, chicken, and proteins. Organic meat,
grass-fed beef. Avoid any animal product with pesticides, toxins, and
hormones. Avoid farm-raised fish. Wild coldwater fish like cod,
mackerel, salmon, halibut, and tuna are best. • Water: 50% of body
weight (pounds) in ounces of filtered or distilled water per day. If you
weigh 150 pounds that is 75 ounces of water, herbal teas, broths daily.
Do not drink from plastic containers or bottles. • Tea: 16 ounces of
decaffeinated green tea per day. • Pomegranate: ¼ cup of pomegranate
seeds per day. • Detox + elimination diet, followed by an
anti-inflammatory, blood-sugar regulating protocol. Emphasize high-fiber
foods and add servings of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli,
cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, etc. • Caloric restriction (CR):
12–14 hours overnight fast with 12.5% caloric restriction and 12.5%
increase in energy expenditure with exercise. PREDIMED
(Mediterranean)-type diet. • FMD (Fasting Mimicking Diet (PROLON) three
months on, then three months off and repeat).

Nonobstructive Coronary Heart Disease and Coronary Artery Vasospasm

INTRODUCTION Nonobstructive coronary heart disease (NO-CHD) is an
atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries that would not be
expected to obstruct blood flow to the heart muscle or result in anginal
symptoms but can cause chest pain, tightness, pressure, shortness of
breath, or myocardial infarction (MI). Coronary artery vasospasm (CAVS)
is anginal chest pain, tightness, pressure, shortness of breath, or MI
with completely normal coronary arteries and no visible plaque by
coronary angiogram. In NO-CHD, although such lesions are relatively
common, occurring in 10–25% of patients undergoing coronary angiography,
their presence has been characterized as “insignificant” or “not
significant CHD” in the medical literature. However, this perception of
NO-CHD may be incorrect, because prior studies have noted that the
majority of plaque ruptures and resultant MIs arise from nonobstructive
plaques as I explained in Chapter 15. In addition, coronary artery spasm
with a temporary tightening (constriction) of the muscles in the wall of
one of the coronary arteries can decrease or completely block blood flow
to the heart muscle. This is likely due to the inflammation, oxidative
stress, and vascular immune dysfunction around the nonobstructive plaque
and low levels of nitric oxide in the artery (this will be discussed in
more detail later in this chapter). In patients with CA-VS, the lumen of
the coronary artery has no visible or documented plaque by coronary
angiography, but the artery may have intense constriction or vasospasm
that obstructs blood flow and causes anginal chest pain, tightness,
pressure, shortness of breath, and, sometimes, an MI. A coronary artery
spasm is a temporary tightening (constriction) of the muscles in the
wall of one of the coronary arteries which can decrease or completely
block blood flow to sections of the heart (Figure 16.1). If a spasm
lasts long enough, you can have anginal chest pain and tightness and
even an MI. Most chest pain or tightness lasts about 15 minutes. Unlike
typical angina, which usually occurs with physical activity, coronary
artery spasms often occur at rest, typically between midnight and early
morning. However, chest pain with exertion also occurs. The other names
for coronary artery spasm are Prinzmetal’s angina, vasospastic angina,
or variant angina. DOI: 10.1201/b22808-17

FIGURE 16.1 Coronary artery spasm showing coronary artery in cross
section on the left and longitudinal section on the right. The wall of
the artery (light red) is constricting into the lumen of the artery on
the right (dark red). This indicates partial obstruction of the artery.

Many people who have coronary artery spasms do not always have the usual
or common risk factors for CHD, such as high cholesterol and high blood
pressure. But they are often smokers and may have diabetes mellitus. If
coronary artery spasm results in a dangerously fast heartbeat
(ventricular arrhythmia), it can result in sudden death.

WHAT CAUSES NO-CHD AND CA-VS? In patients with angina and NO-CHD or
CA-VS, the coronary artery spasm is due to a reduction in nitric oxide
levels in the artery which increases the resistance in the artery and
reduces dilation. Other factors such as vascular inflammation, oxidative
stress, and immune dysfunction may also contribute. Depending on the
severity and duration of the vasospasm, the patient may have anginal
chest pain, tightness, pressure, shortness of breath, or even an MI.
This is associated with a worse prognosis. The vasospasm is often
triggered by extreme emotional stress, anxiety, anger, high blood
pressure, fatigue, high levels of adrenaline or cortisol, tobacco use,
exposure to cold, use of illegal stimulant drugs (such as amphetamines
and cocaine), hyperventilation, or administration of provocative
medications, such as acetylcholine, ergonovine, histamine, or serotonin.
In patients undergoing elective coronary angiography, NO-CHD compared
with patients that had no apparent CHD, there is a significantly greater
one-year risk of recurrent angina and MI. This was also true of patients
with CA-VS in which one of the provocative tests was done with acetyl
choline or ergonovine during coronary angiography. In patients with
CA-VS, the vascular spasm is most frequently observed in the left
anterior descending artery (LAD) (90%) and is most frequently diffuse
(62 %).

DIAGNOSIS OF CORONARY SPASM To diagnose CA-VS, you may need to wear an
ambulatory monitor for up to 48 hours. The monitor records your heart’s
electrical impulses, even during sleep. If you have

chest pain, this usually will show up on the electrocardiogram (EKG)
that indicates coronary spasm. However, not all patients show EKG
changes during every episode. To diagnose coronary spasm, doctors may
prescribe a special type of test called an acetyl choline or ergonovine
stress test. These are drugs that are injected into the coronary artery
during a coronary angiogram. This can trigger coronary spasm, usually
within minutes, at which point that is easily visualized. Then another
medication is injected into the coronary artery to relieve the spasm.
Your EKG is recorded before, during, and after the test.

TREATMENT • Nitrates are used to prevent spasms, improve blood flow, and
quickly relieve chest pain and tightness. These can be given in various
forms, such as oral capsules, under the tongue, sprays, and transdermal
or intravenously. Some are short acting and others are long acting. •
Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) relax the arteries, decrease the spasm,
and increase coronary blood flow. These are used for high blood pressure
and CHD treatment. The best CCBs are nifedipine, amlodipine, and
diltiazem. • Statins are medications that lower cholesterol but also may
prevent spasms, increase nitric oxide, and reduce vascular inflammation.
• Alpha-blockers, especially phentolamine. • Natural compounds that
increase nitric oxide in the arteries, such as NEO 40 and Arterosil.

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS 1. In addition to severe obstructive
CHD, patients may have NO-CHD or CA-VS, both of which cause anginal
chest pain, tightness, pressure, shortness of breath, and MI. 2. The
underlying cause for both NO-CHD and CA-VS is a reduction in arterial
nitric oxide and possible vascular inflammation, oxidative stress, and
immune dysfunction. 3. The diagnosis is made with cardiac monitors and
by injection of certain drugs into the coronary artery during a coronary
angiogram. 4. The treatment is with nitrates, calcium channel blockers,
statins, alphablockers, and some natural compounds that increase
arterial nitric oxide.

Women and Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)

INTRODUCTION Coronary heart disease remains the leading cause of death
in men and women in the US. Coronary heart disease (CHD) kills a higher
percentage of women (55%) than men (43%). Over 300,000 women die each
year from CHD or about one in every five female deaths. CHD is the
leading cause of death for both African American and White women in the
US. Among American Indian and Alaska Native women, CHD and cancer cause
roughly the same number of deaths each year. For Hispanic, Asian, or
Pacific Islander women, CHD is second only to cancer as a cause of
death. About 1 in 16 women age 20 and older (6.2%) has CHD. About 1 in
16 White women (6.1%), Black women (6.5%), and Hispanic women (6%) and 1
in 30 Asian women (3.2%) have CHD. Yet CHD is still considered a
“disease of men”. Many women are unaware that CHD is their main killer.
In addition, there is a lack of awareness of CHD in women among doctors.
At the time of presentation with CHD, women are ten years older than
men, and at the time of their first MI, they are 20 years older. CHD
increases in women after menopause. Women and men with heart disease
tend to differ in their presenting symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment as
well as their overall prognosis. Women may have more atypical symptoms
than men, such as burning in the chest, back pain, abdominal discomfort,
nausea, or fatigue. Women seek medical help less often, which means they
present later in the process of their CHD or MI. They are also less
likely to have procedures and testing, such as coronary angiography
which will delay effective treatment. There are also gender differences
in those that undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). At the
time of presentation of CHD, women are more likely to have comorbid
factors, such as hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes mellitus,
peripheral vascular disease; systolic and diastolic heart failure; and
often need more urgent intervention due to a delayed presentation or
diagnosis. The coronary arteries in women are smaller than those of men
which makes surgical intervention with CABG, angioplasty PCTA, and
stenting more difficult and is associated with a higher mortality rate.

PRESENTING SYMPTOMS OF CHD IN WOMEN These symptoms of CHD in women may
be vague and not as noticeable as the usual chest pain. Women tend to
have blockages not only in their main coronary arteries but also in the
smaller coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle, a condition DOI:

called “small vessel heart disease” or “coronary microvascular disease”.
Women have symptoms more often when resting or asleep. Emotional stress
can play a role in triggering CHD symptoms or MI in women. Below are the
usual symptoms: • Discomfort, burning, pressure, or pain or tingling in
the chest, arm, throat, and back that may occur at night, when sleeping,
or with exertion. • Shortness of breath with exertion. • Dizziness or
light-headedness with exercise. • Sudden onset of fatigue. • Nausea and
vomiting. • Indigestion, gas, and belching. • Feelings of dread and
anxiety. • Sweating. • Abdominal pain in the upper abdomen.

CHD RISK FACTORS FOR CHD IN WOMEN CHD risk factors for women differ from
men. Women with diabetes mellitus have 2.6 times the death rate from CHD
compared to women without diabetes mellitus and a 1.8-fold risk compared
to men with diabetes. Also, hypertension is associated with a two to
three times increased risk of CHD in women. Reduced levels of
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides may be a
better predictor of CHD in women compared to high levels of low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Heart disease risk factors for women that
are more common than in men include the following: • Diabetes mellitus.
Women with diabetes are more likely to have CHD than men with diabetes
mellitus. • Mental stress, anxiety, and depression. • Smoking. •
Menopause. Low levels of estrogen after menopause pose a significant
risk of developing CHD in the small coronary arteries. • Pregnancy
complications. High blood pressure or diabetes during pregnancy can
increase the mother’s long-term risk of both hypertension and CHD. •
Family history of early heart disease. This may be a greater risk factor
in women than in men. • Inflammatory diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis,
systemic lupus, and other autoimmune diseases will increase CHD.

MENOPAUSE AND CHD IN WOMEN After menopause in women who have undergone
early natural menopause (before age 50) or a surgically induced
menopause, a woman’s risk of CHD increases. Estrogen reduces the risk of
CHD. In other words, prior to menopause, the natural production of
estrogen and progesterone is protective against CHD. After menopause,

and progesterone replacement with bioidentical hormones reduces CHD.
After menopause, CHD becomes more of a risk for women due to lower
estrogen levels. Lower levels of estrogen cause the following: • Changes
in the coronary arteries that may cause plaque and blood clots to form.
• Changes in the level of lipids (fats) in the blood will increase CHD
risk. After menopause, levels of LDL (the “bad” cholesterol) increase,
and levels of HDL (the “good” cholesterol) decrease. This leads to more
inflammation and plaque formation. • An increase in fibrinogen (a
substance in the blood that helps the blood to clot). If these levels
are elevated then coronary artery clots may form.

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS 1. CHD and MI are the number-one causes
of death in women in the US. 2. The symptoms of CHD and MI in women are
often different than they are in men. 3. The CHD risk factors may also
be different in women than in men. 4. Women are often diagnosed later
than men and may have a poorer prognosis. 5. Women tend to have worse
results from PTCA, stents, and CABG compared to men. 6. After menopause,
the risk for CHD and MI increase due to a reduction in estrogen,
increased inflammation, changes in blood lipids, and other factors.

Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors The Traditional Top Five Risk
Factors and the Other 400

INTRODUCTION There are many CHD risk factors that I will review and
discuss in this chapter. You hear mostly about the top five CHD risk
factors that include hypertension (high blood pressure), dyslipidemia
(abnormal fats and cholesterol), high blood glucose, diabetes mellitus,
obesity, and smoking. However, there are other CHD risk factors that you
need to know about and have these measured by your doctor. I will divide
these into three groups: 1. Top five CHD risk factors. 2. Top 25
modifiable CHD risk factors. 3. The other 400 CHD risk factors.

TOP FIVE CHD RISK FACTORS The top five CHD risk factors need to be
better defined as I will explain below. The older definitions and
criteria are obsolete and do not evaluate your CHD risk accurately and
therefore do not tell you the best prevention and treatment options for
CHD.

HYPERTENSION A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABM) is the
gold standard in blood pressure (BP) measurement. Measurements of
nocturnal BP and dipping status (normal is a 10% reduction from the
average daytime BP during the night), BP surges, BP load (normal is
&lt;140/90 mm Hg in 15% of the total BP measurements), and BP
variability are superior to random (medical) office BP readings or home
BP readings as a predictor of CHD risk. Excessive dipping is associated
with an increased risk of ischemic stroke and reverse dipping is
associated with an increased risk of intracerebral (brain) hemorrhage.
Nocturnal BP is clinically more important than daytime BP because it
drives CHD and cardiovascular damage (27/15 mm Hg difference is DOI:

optimal). Morning BP surges (both the level and rate of BP rise)
increase the risk of ischemic stroke, MI, and CHD. This often means that
arterial nitric oxide has decreased. The items that should always be
considered when evaluating BP include the following: 1. Normal BP is
120/80 mm Hg, but there is a continuum of risk for CHD starting at
110/70 mm Hg. 2. Each increase of BP of 20/10 mm Hg doubles CHD. 3.
Before 50 years of age, diastolic BP is a better predictor of CHD risk.
4. After 50 years of age, systolic BP is a better predictor of CHD risk.
5. Twenty-four-hour ABM is more accurate than office BP measurements and
should be the standard of care for defining BP, CHD risk, and treatment
options, as well as the type of BP medication, the dose, and the time of
administration of antihypertensive drugs. 6. Mercury sphygmomanometers
are preferred, as they are more accurate and not subject to the wear and
tear of needle BP monitors. Electronic arm units are accurate if done
correctly and validated. Wrist or finger monitors are not as accurate
and should not be used as the basis for a hypertension diagnosis or
management until better technologies become available.

DYSLIPIDEMIA Dyslipidemia should be evaluated using advanced lipid
profiles to determine treatment and predict individual CHD risk more
accurately. An advanced lipid profile can be obtained from almost any
lab. This will include the following: • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •

Total cholesterol. LDL-C. LDL particle number (LDL-P), which drives CHD
risk. LDL sizes—the small dense type B LDL is more atherogenic compared
to the large type A LDL. Modified LDL (oxidized, glycated,
glyco-oxidized, and acetylated). Apolipoprotein (APO) B and APO A.
Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)). Total high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C). HDL
particle number (HDL-P). HDL size and HDL mapping with the five types of
HDL (pre-beta, alpha 1–4). Dysfunctional HDL (HDL that does not perform
all of its normal functions such as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT),
etc.). Myeloperoxidase (MPO). APO C-III. Very low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (VLDL-C) and triglycerides. Large VLDL. VLDL-P (VLDL
particle number). Remnant particles.

DYSGLYCEMIA, HYPERGLYCEMIA, INSULIN RESISTANCE, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND
DIABETES MELLITUS A fasting blood sugar (FBS) of &gt;75 mg/dL increases
CHD by 1% for each 1 mg/ dL increase in FBS and induces endothelial
dysfunction. The current upper limit of blood sugar by most labs is 100
mg/dL which is too high. A two-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) &gt;110
mg/dL increases CHD by 2% for each 1 mg/dL &gt;110 mg/ dL. The current
definition of an abnormal two-hour GTT is &gt;140 mg/dL, which is too
high and not accurate. High levels of blood insulin (hyperinsulinemia)
are an independent risk factor for CHD. Calculating a Homeostatic Model
Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) score will provide additional
insight into the clinical presence of insulin resistance and metabolic
syndrome. Multiplying the FBS by the fasting insulin level and dividing
by 405 will give an excellent estimate of insulin resistance by the
HOMA-IR. A normal HOMA-IR is &lt;1.0, mild insulin resistance is
1.0–2.0, and diabetes mellitus is over 2.0. Diabetes mellitus is defined
as three FBS in three separate blood samples over 125 mg/dL and a
hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) over 7%. The HbA1C is composed of the post-meal
blood glucose (2/3) and fasting glucose (1/3). In men and women without
DM between 50 and 75 years of age, HbA1C is an independent risk for CHD
as a continuous variable starting with HbA1C as low as 5.1%. For each
increase of HbA1C of 1% the risk for CHD increases by 40% in men and
240% in women.

OBESITY AND BODY FAT Body weight and body mass index (BMI) correlate
with CHD and MI. However, the total body fat and especially belly fat
(visceral fat) correlates with CVD, CHD, and MI much better. Body fat
and regional fat can be measured with a machine called body impedance
analysis (BIA) (Figure 18.1). Normal body fat is 22% or less for women
and 16% or less for men. At a total body fat (TBF) of 29%, most men will
have metabolic syndrome. At a TBF of 37%, most women will have metabolic
syndrome.

The primary CHD risk related to LDL-C is LDL-P, APO B, and dense small
LDL. HDL-P is more protective against CHD and more predictive than total
HDL for reducing CHD risk. The larger HDL type 2b is also an important
protective mechanism. Although the smaller pre-beta HDL are more
efficient at reverse cholesterol transport. The larger HDL may be more
protective against CHD, as it will decrease inflammation, oxidative
stress, and immune dysfunction. However, HDL size is now more
controversial as to its relative protection for CHD. Patients who have
an HDL of 85 mg/dL often have dysfunctional HDL, which does not perform
its normal functions (such as reverse cholesterol transport), does not
have the same antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-immune
properties, and may not be protective. HDL function is the most
important measurement for HDL in predicting CHD. The very low-density
lipoprotein (VLDL), especially large VLDL, TGs, and remnant particles,
is very atherogenic and thrombogenic.

FIGURE 18.1 The types and location of the various fats. AT is adipose or
fat tissue.

FIGURE 18.2 Distribution of visceral fat shown in white on an abdominal
CT scan in a normal patient and one with Type 2 diabetes.

Visceral or abdominal fat has the highest correlation with CHD and MI,
as it produces over 45 substances called adipokines (Figure 18.2). These
adipokines cause vascular inflammation, oxidative stress, immune
dysfunction, thrombosis, high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol (with
low HDL and high triglycerides), high blood sugar, diabetes,
hyperinsulinemia, as well as other CHD risk factors, and increases the
risk for CHD and MI. Reduction in body and visceral fat while preserving
the lean muscle mass will correct many of the CHD risk factors and the
CHD risk.

SMOKING Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the
United States and an important cause of CHD and MI. Smoking raises your
risk of getting CHD and dying early from CHD. Apo E 4 carriers have the
highest risk of CHD with smoking. Carbon monoxide, nicotine, and other
substances in tobacco smoke can promote atherosclerosis and trigger
symptoms of CHD. Smoking causes the following problems: • Inflammation,
oxidative stress, and increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(HS-CRP). • The platelets in your blood clump together more easily and
are more likely to form clots. Clumping platelets can then block your
coronary arteries and cause an MI. • Precipitate spasms occur in your
coronary arteries, which reduces the blood flow to your heart and
induces anginal chest pain, shortness of breath, or MI. • Triggers
irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). • Lowers HDL cholesterol, which is
protects against CHD. • Reduces the amount of oxygen that can be carried
by red blood cells to all tissues and to the heart. • Produces
constriction of the systemic arteries and causes hypertension. •
Increases fibrinogen in the blood, making it thicker and more likely to
clot. Smoking also affects those around you. Secondhand smoke increases
other people’s risk of CHD. Smoking cessation reduces CHD and overall
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates rapidly after you stop
smoking.

Top 25 Modifiable CHD Risk Factors Measuring only the top five CHD risk
factors is not sufficient to determine your CHD and MI risk. It is
mandatory that your top 25 modifiable CHD risk factors be properly
evaluated and effectively treated. In addition, new definitions and
testing of the top five risk factors is also now recommended. All of
these are reviewed below. Following are the top five CHD risk factors:
1. Hypertension. In addition to office and home BP monitoring, the new
gold standard to evaluate BP and CHD risk is the 24-hour ambulatory
blood pressure monitoring (ABM) discussed in the Hypertension section of
this chapter. 2. Dyslipidemia. An advanced blood lipid analysis that
measures all the different lipid particle numbers and sizes as well a
test to determine the function of HDL is much more accurate than the old
standard lipid profiles. See the Dyslipidemia section in this chapter.

3.  Hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes
    mellitus. Evaluate all blood tests to determine the fasting glucose,
    two-hour GTT, insulin levels, and HbA1C. See this section in this
    chapter.
4.  Obesity. Measure the total body fat, regional fat, visceral fat, and
    lean muscle with the BIA. See the Obesity section in this chapter.
5.  Smoking. Must be stopped immediately. Also stop all e-cigarettes and
    vaping. See the Smoking section in this chapter.

Following are the other top 20 CHD risk factors:

Hyperuricemia Hyperuricemia (high uric acid) increases risk of
hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, stroke, heart
failure, high coronary artery calcium, CHD, MI, thrombosis, fat storage,
insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia,
sympathetic nervous system overactivity, and chronic kidney disease. The
risk for CHD, MI, and hypertension is increased three to five times
proportional to the blood uric acid level. Hyperuricemia is present in
25–47% of hypertensive patients, and 50% of these are on diuretics.
Hyperuricemia causes resistant hypertension in the elderly. The risk of
hypertension in all patients starts at 6 mg/dL in men and 5 mg/dL in
women. Each increase in 1 mg/dL in blood uric acid increases the risk of
hypertension by 13%. Humans lack an important enzyme called uricase that
converts uric acid to a soluble form. The uric acid level should be kept
below 5 mg/dL. Uric acid can be both antioxidant and pro-oxidant
depending on the blood level and the location in or outside of the cell.
At high levels, uric acid will increase oxidative stress, inflammation,
immune dysfunction of blood vessels, increase artery stiffness, lower
nitric oxide, and increase sodium sensitivity and blood pressure.
Hyperuricemia may be genetic, drug-related (diuretics, beta blockers,
aspirin), or due to obesity, alcohol consumption, increased red meat in
the diet, fructose intake, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome,
diabetes mellitus, obesity, dehydration, chronic kidney disease, some
types of seafood, small bowel disease, and cancer. There are many ways
to reduce uric acid in addition to looking at all of these causes and
removing or treating them. For example: • Allopurinol lowers BP 3.3/1.3
mm Hg, and improves endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, CHD,
and heart failure. • Estrogen increases the urinary excretion of uric
acid. • Folate also lowers uric acid. • Losartan lowers uric acid. This
is a drug used for hypertension. Renal Disease Chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is associated with CHD risk that is equal to or greater than other
established very high-risk conditions. In fact, CKD is 2 times the risk
compared to diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and smoking. The glomerular
filtration rate (GFR), blood creatinine and cystatin C, the urinary
protein (proteinuria), and

microalbumin in the urine (microalbuminuria) all correlate as
independent risk factors for CHD. Albumin in the urine
(microalbuminuria) is one of the earliest abnormalities in the vascular
system and kidney that reflects endothelial dysfunction and increased
vascular permeability. Microalbuminuria has a high correlation with
progression to more proteinuria, renal disease, CHD, MI, heart failure,
and stroke. A single urine sample with a blood creatinine can measure an
important lab called the albumin creatinine ratio (ACR). An increased
ACR predicts a linear relationship between coronary microvascular
dysfunction and CHD. There is a linear relationship of ACR starting at 5
mg/gm. There are many BP drugs that can improve both CKD and
microalbuminuria, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). In addition, omega-3 FA
and R lipoic acid may reduce microalbuminuria. Elevated Fibrinogen An
elevated blood fibrinogen is directly associated with increased
thrombotic rate and increases the risk of CHD, MI, stroke, and overall
mortality by 81%. For each 50 mg/dL increase in blood fibrinogen, there
is a 30% increase in CHD. Plasma viscosity, or the thickness of the
blood, correlates with fibrinogen and is an independent CHD risk factor.
Fibrinogen is an acute and chronic phase reactant that is made in the
liver. It increases plaque growth, platelet adhesion, inflammation,
atherosclerosis, and cholesterol synthesis. The blood levels should be
below 380 mg/dL but the lowest risk is below 288 mg /dL. See Figure
18.3. Elevated Serum Iron Iron can be measured in the blood by serum
iron and a ferritin which is the liver storage form of iron. Both are
important and predict increased risk for CHD and other medical problems.
The blood iron is bound to proteins that transport it and is called the
total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). So, a high serum iron and a high
saturation are bad. Below are some of the problems that are associated
with an increase in iron levels. 1. Increased risk of CHD, MI, and
carotid artery disease. 2. Increased iron levels may be genetic due to
the HFE C282Y mutation and is called hemochromatosis. 3. Enhanced iron
mediates oxidative stress, LDL oxidation, contributes to dyslipidemia,
endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and CHD. 4. High iron is
related to the severity of perfusion, blood flow, and functional
abnormalities of coronary arteries. Although there may be an obstruction
with plaque, most of the time iron causes coronary microvascular disease
with angina and endothelial dysfunction of the coronary arteries. 5.
Ferritin measures iron stores and CHD risk. Ferritin levels over 200
µg/L increase CHD and MI risk by 2 times. 6. Insulin resistance and
hyperglycemia and DM are increased. 7. Increases LDL and decreases HDL.
8. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

FIGURE 18.3 Fibrinogen increases total mortality depending on the blood
level. The higher the level the greater the death rate. Levels should be
below 380 mg/dL, but the lowest risk would be below 288 mg/dL.

9.  Increased mitochondrial dysfunction.
10. Oxidative stress is increased.
11. Inflammation is increased. Lowering the iron burden with
    professional chronic phlebotomy improves cardiovascular outcomes of
    CHD, MI, stroke, and life expectancy. A serum ferritin level of 76.5
    ng/ml has the lowest event rate for CHD. Trans fatty acids and
    refined carbohydrates. Avoid TFA and decrease refined carbohydrates
    to less than 25 grams per day. See this section in Chapter 12 Part I

    omega 3 FA until the blood omega 3 index is over 8. See this section
    in Chapter 12 Part I on Nutrition. Low dietary potassium and
    magnesium with high sodium intake. Increase dietary potassium and

    inflammation blood markers to normal. See Chapter 6. Increased
    vascular oxidative stress and decreased oxidative defense. Reduce
    oxidative stress and increase oxidative defense. See Chapter 6.

Lack of Sleep Short sleep duration of less than six hours is an
independent risk factor for CHD, MI, hypertension, heart failure,
diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome, silent cerebral infarcts
and future strokes, and increased mortality. Prolonged sleep if over ten
hours increases CVA risk also. Eight hours appears to be the perfect
sleep duration for most people to prevent CHD, MI, and these other
events. Lack of Exercise Physical inactivity will increase CHD risk. The
exercise recommendations are discussed in detail in Chapter 21 on
aerobic and resistance training with the ABCT exercise program. Please
read that chapter for details. • 4200 kilo joules (17,566 KC) per week
of aerobic exercise to achieve maximal CHD reduction. • Do not exercise
for more than one hour per day. 40 minutes resistance and 20 minutes
aerobic training is recommended. • Exercise at least four days per week.
• Sitting for long periods of time is equivalent to smoking. A study in
the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that those who sit (for
example, watching TV) for an hour reduce their lifespan by 22 minutes,
whereas smokers shorten their lives by 11 minutes on average per
cigarette. One study in Diabetologia, the journal of the European
Association for the Study of Diabetes, confirmed the danger by comparing
those who spent the most time sitting versus those who sat the least.
Those who sat the most faced a 112% increase in diabetes, a 147%
increase in death from cardiovascular events, a 90% increase in death
from cardiovascular causes, and a 49% increase in death from all causes.
Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Chronic stress, anxiety, and depression
increase the risk of CHD and MI though an imbalance of the autonomic
nervous system (ANS) with increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
activity. See Chapter 14. Homocysteinemia Homocysteine is a sulfur-based
amino acid derived from the plant and animal-based amino acid called
methionine. The metabolism is very complex and involves many biochemical
pathways and many vitamins via methylation (50%) and transulfuration
(50%). I will try to simplify the relationship of elevated homocysteine
levels to CHD below. See also Figure 18.4. • There is a continuum of
risk for CHD starting at levels of 5 micromoles/L, but the greatest risk
starts at 12 mm/L or more. • Elevated homocysteine blood levels are
associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, inhibition of the
important enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx), arterial damage,
endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, platelet aggregation, stroke,
neurodegenerative disease, CHD, and renal disease.

FIGURE 18.4 Homocysteine and folate metabolism.

• Many factors are thought to raise levels of homocysteine. These
include a poor diet, smoking, high coffee consumption, increased alcohol
intake, some prescription drugs, such as cholestyramine, metformin,
nicotinic acid (niacin), and fibric acid derivatives (used to lower
triglycerides and cholesterol), and diseases, such as diabetes,
rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, and poor thyroid function. • The
treatment of elevated homocysteine involves B vitamins (vitamins B6, B2,
B12), methylated folic acid, and several amino acids (S adenosyl
methionine SAME, betaine, serine, and glycine)—and possibly vitamin C,
vitamin E, and N acetyl cysteine (see Figure 18.4). • Other treatments
include genetic evaluation for enzyme defects and removing or treating
any causes as stated above. Subclinical Hypothyroidism The thyroid
gland, which resides in the lower neck, produces the hormones thyroxine
(or T4) and tri-idothyronine (or T3) which control many metabolic
processes in the body. It is one of the most important endocrine glands.
An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) that does not produce enough T4
or T3 is associated with CHD. Blood tests will identify thyroid problems
and include total T4, free T4, free T3, thyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH) (from the pituitary gland in the brain), thyroid-binding proteins,
such as thyroid binding globulin (TBG), and thyroid antibodies. Once
identified, there are many supplemental thyroid medications that can

be administered to correct the thyroid function back to normal.
Hypothyroidism is associated with these conditions: • CHD, MI, heart
failure, and general atherosclerosis. • Heart rhythm problems, such as
ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and atrial
fibrillation. • Sudden death. • Hypertension and dyslipidemia. •
Homocysteinemia. • Endothelial dysfunction. • Obesity. • Metabolic
syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes. • Increased carotid disease.
• Arterial stiffness. The TSH is one of the earliest blood abnormalities
seen with primary hypothyroidism of the thyroid gland. A TSH over 2.5
mIU/ml is considered abnormal. There are normal values in the lab for
each of the thyroid tests mentioned and all should be measured. Hormonal
Imbalances in Both Genders There is evidence that declining sex hormones
in both genders will increase the risk of CHD and MI. There is also
evidence that the appropriate and optimal replacement of sex hormones in
the correct clinical setting will reduce the risk of CHD and MI. The lab
tests for men should include total testosterone, free testosterone, and
sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). The lab tests for women should
include estrone, estradiol, estriol, progesterone, follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). If treatment is required,
then bioidentical hormone replacement (BIHRT) is preferred. You should
consult with a specialist in hormone replacement or an endocrinologist.
A gynecologist is also suggested for women. Chronic Clinical or
Subclinical Infections All types of organisms including bacteria,
viruses, parasites, tuberculosis, and fungi (commonly called
microorganisms) can increase the risk of CHD and MI. This association is
true for both active, previous, or inactive infections. This is called
the lifetime pathogenic burden of infections. There is clearly a link
between infectious burden, history of infections, active infections, and
atherosclerosis. The greater the number of microorganisms to which one
displays a previous immune experience (reactive T cells or IgG antibody
levels), the greater is the CHD. This pathogenic burden of various
microorganisms has a significant correlation with endothelial
dysfunction, coronary artery spasm, the presence coronary artery plaque
and the severity of CHD as defined by coronary artery calcification
(CAC) scan and coronary arteriograms. I will now outline the present
relationships and findings of all of these infections and the risk of
CHD and MI.

• Individual microorganisms also have significant correlations with CHD,
including periodontal microbes, herpes simplex virus (HSV),
cytomegalovirus (CMV), H. Pylori, Chlamydia Pneumoniae, Hepatitis A, B,
C, HIV, and Epstein Barr virus (EBV), and all bacteria and others as
defined by the production of IgG and IgM antibodies. H. pylori-positive
patients with endothelial dysfunction (ED) had resolution of the ED
after treatment and eradication of the H. pylori infection. • The DNA of
many viruses and bacteria can be detected in the coronary arteries and
in the plaque at autopsy. • In the presence of a chronic bacterial
infection (periodontal or gum disease being the most common),
mononuclear cells, such as T cells, infiltrate the gum tissue, gobble up
the corresponding microbes, and digest them. If that mononuclear cell
happens to traverse a coronary artery containing an active plaque, it
may be nonspecifically pulled into the lesion. There it may display gum
microbes which induce inflammation and an immune response that activates
the plaque to an unstable form that is prone to rupture. • There is a
strong association between an acute myocardial infarction and acute
bacterial and viral infections. This risk is highest the first few weeks
after the infection but remains elevated for a year after severe
infection. This is mediated by trained immunity.

Micronutrient Deficiencies Almost any micronutrient deficiency can
increase the risk of CHD and MI through a wide variety of mechanisms.
The list is extensive and includes all vitamins, antioxidants, minerals,
various enzymes, amino acids, and other nutrients (Table 18.1). Various
supplements such as vitamin K2 MK 7, omega-3 fatty acids, niacin,
luteolin, (celery, green pepper, rosemary, carrots, oregano, oranges,
olives), curcumin, quercetin, magnesium, grapeseed extract, NAC (N
acetyl cysteine), and aged garlic reduce CHD risk, plaque formation, and
CAC. In addition, foods such as pomegranate, broccoli, green tea, or
green tea extract (EGCG) will be effective. Two other natural
proprietary compounds called NEO 40 and Arterosil will improve nitric
oxide levels, dilate the coronary arteries, stabilize plaque, and reduce
plaque (Arterosil) The combination of many of these will stabilize
plaque, reduce plaque volume, reduce the lipid core, and decrease the
coronary artery calcium (CAC). Heavy Metals All heavy metals such as
mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, and iron increase the risk of CHD and
MI through many mechanisms, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and
mitochondrial damage. These should be measured in both blood and urine
in a baseline state and the repeated in a provoked method using
chelators. If any are increased, then the source must by identified and
removed with oral or intravenous chelation therapy. Environmental
Pollutants Any type of environmental pollutant in the water, air, and
food, such as pesticides, organocides, particulate matter, or other
sources will increase the risk of CHD and

THE OTHER 400 CHD RISK FACTORS In addition to the top 5 and the top 25
CHD risk factors there are about 400 new and emerging CHD risk factors
that should be evaluated and measured in certain cases based on history,
clinical exam, family history, known CHD risk factors, known CHD or
previous MI and other labs. This list is very extensive so I will only
list these in Table 18.2. Due to the limited space in this book, it is

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS 1. The top five CHD risk factors must
be redefined and evaluated accurately and treated in all patients. 2.
The top modifiable 25 CHD risk factors should now be included in the
evaluation of patients with any risk of CHD or known CHD. 3. Other CHD
risk factors, metabolomics, and proteomics in blood and urine are now
emerging and will be important in the future evaluation of CHD risk. 4.
Early measurement of the top 25 modifiable CHD risk factors and early,
aggressive, and appropriate prevention and treatment will help prevent
and reduce CHD and MI.

19 Labs, Noninvasive, and Testing

Invasive Testing CLINICAL SIGNS, BLOOD TESTS, AND NONINVASIVE VASCULAR
TESTING FOR HYPERTENSION AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE There are many
clinical signs, blood tests, and other noninvasive vascular tests that
your doctor can order to determine if you have developed any damage to
your arteries, endothelium, heart, brain, kidneys, eyes, or aorta. These
tests will accurately define your present clinical cardiovascular damage
that is related to all of your CHD risk factors and also predict your
risk of future cardiovascular, such as a CHD, MI, stroke, heart failure,
kidney failure, retinal damage, or aortic aneurysm. Let us take a look
at each of these organs that can be damaged, what tests are available,
and discuss what they mean and how to treat the findings (1–19).

The Arteries The Computerized Arterial Pulse Wave Analysis (CAPWA) is a
machine (CV Profiler—see the Sources section on testing equipment) that
can measure the stiffness or elasticity of the large, medium-size, and
small resistance arteries throughout the body in a noninvasive manner
using computer analysis (20–24). The results are standardized, based on
your age and gender, to give you a score called “compliance of the
arteries”, which is a measure of their elasticity. The scores for
compliance for the big and medium arteries are called “C-1 compliance”,
and for the small resistance arteries, they are called the “C -2
compliance”. The higher the compliance number the more elastic the
artery and the lower is your risk of a future CHD or a cardiovascular
event. The stiffer the artery the lower the compliance score and the
more likely you already have damage from CHD risk factors. This gives
you a point in time that accurately estimates your vascular age and your
future risk for a CHD, MI, stroke, heart failure, and possibly kidney
disease. In many cases, the smaller resistance arteries are abnormal
decades before a CHD event occurs. This is an excellent clinical tool to
detect and then treat you early before more arterial damage might occur
(20–24).

One of the best validated early detection tests for functional
abnormalities of the endothelium is the EndoPAT (see the Sources
section) which determines endothelial function and dysfunction (25–29).
The EndoPAT measures the blood flow in your arm after a five-minute
occlusion of the brachial (arm) artery which is an excellent indirect
measure of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Endothelial dysfunction in
the arteries may predict future CHD, MI, and hypertension or be directly
related to a disease that now exists and is causing arterial damage
(Figure 19.1). If the EndoPAT shows endothelial dysfunction, it predicts
accurately the future risk for hypertension, CHD, angina, MI, congestive
heart failure, cardiac death, hospitalization, coronary artery bypass
graft, stent restenosis, the presence of plaque in the coronary arteries
that are rupture prone, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and stroke
(25–29). Endothelial dysfunction is defined as a score of less than
1.67. A really good score is over 2.1.

Carotid Artery Ultrasound The carotid arteries are located on both sides
of the neck and supply blood to the brain. They can become thick, stiff,
or blocked with plaque. This will reduce the blood supply to the brain,
or a piece of the plaque could break off and go to the brain and cause a
stroke (embolic stroke) (Figures 19.2 and 19.3) (28–30). Hypertension is

the EndoPAT. The top curve shows a normal artery with proper dilation
after a brief occlusion of the brachial artery. Note the height of the
black curve, called “reactive hyperemia”, which is increased compared to
the other arm at the bottom. The ratio of the two curves determines the
score for the EndoPAT.

THE EYE AND THE RETINA The retina or fundus examination (back of the
eye) which contains the retinal arterioles is a window to the arteries
in the brain and correlates highly with hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
dyslipidemia, smoking, CHD, atherosclerosis and with disease in the
small arteries in other organs throughout the body (33–36). Retinal
damage indicates microvascular (small vessels) disease. Retinal
microvascular endothelial dysfunction assessed with special eye testing
shows that retinal artery health and dilation is dependent on nitric
oxide and predicts hypertension, stroke, CHD, and MI (33–36).
Endothelial dysfunction of the coronary arteries by EndoPAT has a very
high correlation with endothelial dysfunction of the retina. In
addition, hemorrhages, exudates, artery thickening, and damage may be
seen (Figure 19.4).

CORONARY ARTERY CALCIFICATION Coronary artery calcification (CAC)
happens as the coronary arteries age and calcium is deposited in the
muscular wall of the artery or a plaque inside the artery lumen, thus
obstructing the blood flow (37–40) (Figure 19.5). The calcium in the
four primary larger coronary arteries increases as you age and is
related to all risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol,
diabetes mellitus, obesity, or smoking. The higher the CAC score, based
on age and gender, the greater the risk for CHD and MI. A normal

common cause of plaque and stroke, especially if there are other risk
factors such as diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, obesity, or
smoking. The thickness of the endothelium and the muscle of the carotid
artery is called the carotid intimal media thickness (IMT). This IMT
predicts future risk of CHD, MI, and stroke (30–32). Normal values for
the carotid IMT must be adjusted for age and gender. A carotid IMT of
less than 0.6 mm is normal to low risk, 0.6 to 0.7 mm is moderate risk
and 0.7 to 0.95 mm is high risk for future CHD, MI, or stroke. The
normal carotid IMT growth rate is less than 0.016 mm/year. The risk for
a CHD and MI is 26% greater per 0.10 mm growth of the carotid artery IMT
difference over five years. The risk for stroke is 32% higher per 0.10
mm growth of the carotid artery IMT over five years (30–32).

and ventricular chambers, thickening, stiffness, and enlargement of the
heart muscle (hypertrophy), pressures in the heart and heart valve
damage (insufficiency or regurgitation), and stenosis. The ECHO also
shows the heart function and pumping action (ejection fraction),
stiffness of the ventricles (diastolic dysfunction), and congestive
heart failure. Hypertension and CHD with blockage of the blood flow to
the heart muscle can dilate the various chambers of the heart, make them
stiff, cause enlargement, hypertrophy (LVH), and heart failure (41).
Also, if a valve is leaking or stenotic, the ECHO will show it (Figure
19.6). Finally, the ECHO may show an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta (big
artery in the chest as it comes out of the heart).

AORTIC ULTRASOUND FOR ANEURYSMS AND KIDNEY SIZE An ultrasound of the
abdomen can show the size of the aorta, if an aneurysm is present, or if
it is dilated or has plaque present. An aneurysm is a weakened artery
wall that

enlarges, and when a certain size is reached, it may rupture. In
addition a renal ultrasound will show the size of the kidneys. Small
kidneys indicate damage from hypertension and atherosclerosis with
declining function and progression to chronic renal disease (CKD). As
noted previously, chronic kidney disease is a major risk factor for CHD
and MI.

CENTRAL BLOOD PRESSURE AND AORTIC STIFFNESS (AUGMENTATION INDEX) It is
possible to measure the blood pressure centrally in the aorta just as it
comes out of the heart (42). This is a more accurate blood pressure
reading than the one that we take in the arm. In addition, the AtCor
machine measures the stiffness or elasticity of the aorta and the distal
artery branches to predict the augmentation index (Figure 19.7).
Hypertension causes the arteries to become stiff so that a wave of
pressure in the artery wall bounces back to the aorta near the heart
that further increases the systolic blood pressure and the risk for
stroke, heart failure, CHD, and MI. This is called the “augmentation
index” (42).

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM AND CARDIOPULMONARY EXERCISE TESTING An
electrocardiogram shows heart rate and rhythm and possible heart damage
from a previous MI. Types of electrical heart blocks, extra heartbeats
(from the atria, premature atrial beats or PACs and from the ventricle,
premature ventricular beats or PVCs), other electrical issues, heart
chamber enlargement, heart stress, and other problems due to CHD.
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) will determine the risk for CHD
with blockage in the arteries, spasm of the coronary arteries, extra
heartbeats with exercise, lung function, blood pressure, and heart rate
response to exercise and recovery during exercise. These and other
findings help to predict cardiovascular events.

COMPLETE AND ADVANCED CARDIOVASCULAR LABORATORY TESTING A complete
cardiovascular blood panel with advanced testing should be done to
evaluate cardiovascular, CHD, and kidney damage. These are listed in
Table 19.1.

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS 1. Several noninvasive vascular tests
will predict the risk for CHD or MI decades before an event occurs. 2.
These noninvasive vascular tests will predict the presence and severity
of CHD and the risk for MI. 3. Numerous supporting blood tests also
predict CHD and MI. 4. All of these tests are available clinically. 5.
Immediate prevention and treatment programs can be started to correct
these abnormal tests and prevent the progression of CHD or an MI.

How to Assess Your Risk Using CHD Scoring Tests

Once you have obtained the results of all of your history, physical
exam, blood tests, genetics, and noninvasive cardiovascular disease
tests, your doctor can calculate your risk for coronary heart disease
(CHD) and myocardial infarction (MI) using several different validated
CHD risk-scoring systems. These will be discussed in this chapter. I
recommend that these scoring systems be calculated and interpreted by
your physician, as they are complicated. I would not recommend that you
attempt to do these on your own but ask your doctor to obtain the tests
for each one, calculate the score for you and interpret the results, and
then institute your prevention and treatment programs.

FRAMINGHAM RISK SCORE The Framingham Risk Score (FRS) estimates the risk
of developing CHD within a ten-year time period. It is now a common
practice to double the FRS if there is a family history of premature CHD
in a first-degree relative (men &lt;55years, women &lt;65years).
Patients with a ten-year risk of CHD ≥5% are considered high risk.
Please note that the FRS is an older scoring system and, although still
used, is not as accurate as others that are discussed in this chapter.
Also note the FRS measures only the RISK of developing CHD and not
mortality. Secondly, it is a ten-year estimate. These are the criteria
that are measured: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.

Gender. Age. Total cholesterol. HDL cholesterol. Systolic blood
pressure. On medication for hypertension. Smoker. Diabetes mellitus.
Known vascular disease, such as CHD or stroke.

If the family history is positive for CHD, then the score is doubled.
Framingham Risk Score for Women Based on Age with Points for Each Age

COSEHC GLOBAL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK CALCULATION The Consortium of
Southeastern Hypertension Centers (COSEHC) score estimates the risk of
death from CHD or MI within five years with both absolute and relative
risk. Please note that this score has more variables, estimates CHD
death as absolute and relative risk, and also is a five-year (not

these tests. For each of these tests a numeric score is assigned as
shown in the table below. The total score is calculated and the six-year
risk of having a CHD event is shown below. The Rasmussen scoring is
superior to the FRS. • Disease score 0–2: no CHD events in six years. •
Disease score 3–5: 5% chance of CHD events in six years. • Disease score
over 6: 15% chance of CHD events in six years. The higher the score the
greater the risk of CHD within six years (see Figure 20.4).

CHAN2T 3 CHD SCORING SYSTEM The CHAN2T 3 CHD scoring system predicts the
risk of a CHD event in ten years as shown below. A score of 5 indicates
a 25% risk of a CHD event during this time period of ten years (see
Figure 20.5).

PULS CARDIAC TEST (CHL) The PULS is a blood test predicts the five-year
risk of having an MI and estimates your heart age. Figures 20.6–20.9 and

GENE EXPRESSION TESTING GES (Gene Expression Score) Corus CHD CORUS is a
blood test that measures the risk of having plaque or obstruction in
your coronary arteries. The higher the score the higher the risk. • Gene
expression test that measures changes in WBC/RNA (white blood
cell/ribonucleic acid) levels that are sensitive to the presence of
coronary plaque. • Measures expression levels of 23 genes grouped into
six categories. • Highly correlated with quantitative coronary artery
angiogram (QCA) and degree of stenosis. • Correlated QCA with Corus gene
expression. • The higher the Corus score (0–40) the greater the chance
of a 50% or greater stenosis in one major coronary artery and greater
risk of future major adverse CV event (MACE). • Score &lt; 15 = low risk
for CHD. • Score 28 = 50% chance of major CHD. • Score 40 = 68% chance
of major CHD.

MEASUREMENTS The score is divided into three groups including a low,
moderate, and high risk of CHD, MI, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Low
risk is 0–3; moderate is 4–7; high risk is greater than 7.​

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS 1. There are many validated scoring
systems that will predict your risk for CHD and MI. 2. Each measures
different variables such as blood tests, genetics, gender, vascular
tests, and predicts a CHD event, CHD death, MI, or obstructive CHD. 3.
It is important to obtain all of the tests for each of the scoring
systems and have your doctor calculate your risk for CHD and MI and
interpret the results for you. 4. Based on these scoring systems,
additional diagnostic testing and treatment will be indicated.

The Integrative Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Prevention Program

NUTRITION Nutrition is the foundation for the prevention and treatment
of coronary heart disease (CHD). Nutritional studies provide definitive
proof that CHD can be prevented or reduced with a weighted plant-based
diet that includes 12 servings of fruits and vegetables per day (4
fruits and 8 vegetables). You should consume more monounsaturated fats
(MUFA), omega-3 fatty acids, nuts, whole grains and coldwater fish. The
MUFA should include 25 grams per day of olive products, such as olives
and olive oil (especially extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)), and mixed
nuts. The omega-3 fats should be about 3–5 grams per day with coldwater
fish and supplemental omega-3 fatty acids. Reduce all of the starches,
sweets, refined carbohydrates, and sugars to less than 25 grams per day.
Sucrose, sugar substitutes, high fructose corn syrup, and processed
foods should be stopped. One should completely eliminate all trans fats
(TFA). Eggs and dairy products are not associated with CHD. Long chain
SFAs should be reduced to less than 10 percent of fat intake. Organic
grass-fed beef and wild game may reduce CHD. High intake of potassium of
about 5 grams per day and magnesium to 1000 mg per day are recommended
in conjunction with sodium restriction of 1500 mg per day. The best
overall nutritional programs include the modified and updated DASH 1 and
DASH 2 diets and the PREDIMED-TMD diet (Mediterranean diet). See Chapter
12 on nutrition for a detailed discussion.

NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS Many nutritional supplements, vitamins,
antioxidants, and minerals will help prevent and treat CHD by improving
coronary artery elasticity and vasodilation, endothelial dysfunction,
and glycocalyx dysfunction; increasing blood flow in the coronary
arteries; reducing elevated blood pressure; stabilizing or reducing
plaque formation; decreasing or stabilizing coronary artery calcium; and
lowering vascular inflammation, vascular oxidative stress, and vascular
immune dysfunction. All patients should have blood tests to measure all
the micronutrients (micronutrient testing or MNT) to determine any
deficiencies, and you should then take the proper dose of the
micronutrient, vitamin, mineral, or antioxidant. The recommended MNT
testing companies are Vibrant America Labs and Spectracell Labs. See the
Sources section at the end of this book. In addition to correcting
micronutrient deficiencies, you should take the

NEO 40 NEO 40 is a concentrated beet supplement that provides nitrites
to the blood to make nitric oxide. It also contains vitamin C, vitamin
B12, methyl folate, and a proprietary nitric oxide blend (beetroot
powder, Hawthorn berry extract, L-citrulline, and sodium nitrite). The
dose is one wafer twice per day. It is available from Human labs as
Superbeet chewables and Superbeet powder. There are no side effects. See
the Sources section at the end of this book. NEO 40 lowers blood
pressure in hypertensive patients, increases blood flow, improves
endothelial dysfunction, dilates both the small and large arteries to
improve arterial elasticity (C1 and C2 compliance of the arterial wall);
and improves the augmentation index, pulse wave velocity, central
pressure, and forward and backward pulse waves. In addition, NEO 40
improves anginal chest pain, reduces coronary artery spasm and risk of
clotting, decreases platelet stickiness, increases energy and overall
cardiovascular function, and improves exercise function. NEO 40 improves
vascular inflammation, vascular oxidative stress, and vascular immune
dysfunction. Another recommended supplement for nitric oxide is Berkley
Life Nitric Oxide support. Be cautious of any other nitric
oxide-boosting supplements, as they have not undergone the scientific
clinical studies as done with NEO 4 (see Chapters 5 and 19).

Arterosil Arterosil is a compound containing a marine-based specialized
sulfated polysaccharide (SSP), which has been verified to regenerate the
glycocalyx. Arterosil contains rhamnan sulfate, a specialized sulfated
polysaccharide derived from the green seaweed Monostroma nitidum.
Rhamnan sulfate is a glycocalyx regenerating compound (GRC) and has been
reported to possess anticoagulant and antithrombotic activity. GRCs are
regenerating glycocalyx compounds from marine polysaccharides with a
similar structure to the glycosaminoglycans found in the human
endothelial glycocalyx. The Arterosil ingredients include 900 mg green
seaweed (Monostroma sp.) extract, grape (seed and skin) extract, green
tea (leaf) extract, grape pomace (fruit) extract, tomato (fruit), carrot
(root) juice, bilberry (fruit), broccoli (aerial parts), green cabbage
(leaf), onion (bulb), garlic (bulb), grapefruit (fruit), asparagus
(stalk), papaya (fruit), pineapple (fruit), strawberry (fruit), apple
(fruit), apricot (fruit), cherry (fruit), orange (fruit), blackcurrant
(fruit), olive (fruit), and cucumber (fruit). The dose is one capsule
twice per day with food. It is produced by Calroy Health Sciences. See
the Sources section at the end of this book. Arterosil increases nitric
oxide levels, reduces blood pressure in hypertensive patients, increases
blood flow, improves glycocalyx and endothelial dysfunction, pulse wave
velocity, central pressure, forward and backward pulse waves. It

D Ribose Powder D-Ribose is a five-carbon sugar with excellent
absorption and proven benefits in heart disease. It does not increase
blood sugar, and, in some patients, it will lower blood sugar. In fact,
it can be used as a healthy sweetener for beverages. The dose is 5 grams
three times per day in the water. It is produced by Designs for Health
Labs (DFH), Biotics Research Labs, and others. See the Sources section
at the end of this book. D Ribose (part of the structure of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP)) increases energy in the heart muscle. Clinical
results show that it improves heart function and contractility, reduces
anginal chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue; improves coronary
artery blood flow, heart muscle stiffness, and ejection fraction;
decreases heart failure and rhythm abnormalities of the heart; and
increases energy and exercise capability. Rare adverse effects include
low blood glucose, gout, and diarrhea. See Chapters 5 and 19.

Vitamin K2 MK 7 There are two forms of vitamin K—called K1 and K2—and
there are subtypes of each of these. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin.
Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) is found in plant foods, like leafy greens.
Vitamin K2 (menaquinone) is found in animal and fermented foods.
However, supplementing with K2 MK 7 is recommended to obtain an adequate
blood level in order to prevent CHD, coronary artery calcification, and
heart disease. While vitamin K1 is absorbed and used primarily by the
liver, vitamin K2 MK 7 is available, and measurable, in the blood. As
such, unlike vitamin K1, vitamin K2 does not get sequestered in the
liver for only the liver’s function. Rather, because it is available in
serum blood, it can travel and go to work in other areas of the body.
The most important vitamin K in relation to CHD is vitamin K2 MK 7.
Vitamin K2 MK 4 is also good but is less potent and requires 5–10 times
the dose of vitamin K2 MK 7. Vitamin K2 MK 7 also has better absorption
and a longer half-life of 3 days vs hours compared to vitamin K2 MK 4.
Menaquinones are vitamin K2 (gut bacteria) (75% of K) are more effective
than phylloquinone or vitamin K1 (dietary intake) (25% of K) to prevent
vascular disease and vascular calcification. Vitamin K2MK7 is important
for the production of a protein called gamma carboxyglutamate (Gla
matrix protein-MGP) through a process called “carboxylation” that is
important in the prevention of calcification of the coronary arteries,

stabilizes and reduces vulnerable arterial plaque (patent approved for
this indication), decreases soft plaque in the carotid arteries, reduces
the size of the lipid-rich core in plaques; reduces clotting, leukocyte
adhesion, and cell adhesion molecules; decreases atherosclerosis; and
improves large and small arterial stiffness (C1 and C2 arterial
compliance); and improves the augmentation index. And finally, it
improves vascular inflammation, vascular oxidative stress, and vascular
immune dysfunction. There are no side effects. See Chapters 5 and 19.

artery plaque, CHD, and MI. (Figure 21.1) The dose is 360 micrograms per
day or two caps per day. K2 MK 7 is produced by Ortho Molecular labs.
See the Sources section at the end of this book. Vitamin K is also
important in blood coagulation, bone formation and bone density,
osteopenia and osteoporosis, soft tissue calcification, atherosclerosis,
cell growth and normal cell death (apoptosis), cell signaling, cancer
prevention, and brain cell protection. Vitamin K decreases HS-CRP,
carotid IMT, and plaque; increases arterial elasticity; lowers blood
pressure; reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus; and reduces CAC,
aortic calcification, CHD, and total mortality. It improves pulse wave
velocity, central pressure, forward and backward pulse waves (see
Chapters 5 and 19). Vitamin K2 supplementation at 360 micrograms per day
increases maximal cardiac output by 12%. Vitamin K2 MK 7 activates
proteins C and S, which inhibit clotting and reduce inflammation. In
addition, it increases mitochondrial ATP and induces plaque
stabilization. Other effects of vitamin K include: • Enhancing athletic
performance by increasing cardiac output when serum stores are optimal.

its protective actions in mitochondrial health.

Vitamin K effects are enhanced with the co-administration of vitamin D
and vitamin A. At doses of K2 MK 7 below 360 micrograms there is no
alteration in the risk of clotting as measured by the lab test called
PT-INR in patients taking the blood thinner Warfarin. Vitamin K is safe
to take with any other blood thinners. It does not increase the risk of
clotting. Vitamin K1 converts to K2. Vitamin K deficiency occurs in
seven days on a vitamin K deficient diet. Vitamin K2 MK 7 is safe
without adverse effects and has many uses to improve CHD and overall
heart health. Clinical studies in CHD and coronary artery calcification
are very positive regarding vitamin K2. The Nurses Health Study (NHS) of
72,874 female nurses showed a 16% reduction in CHD from lowest to
highest quintile of vitamin K1 intake. In the Health Professional Study
(HPFS) of 40,087 men, there was a 13–16% reduction in CHD. In a
population-based study of 4807 subjects, the incident risk for CHD was
reduced by vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (menaquinone).
Vitamin K2 MK 7 reduced CHD by 57% in upper vs lower tertile and reduced
all-cause mortality by 26% in upper vs lower tertile. K2 reduced aortic
calcification by 52% in upper vs lower tertile and reduced total
mortality by 26%. Evidence linking vitamin K2 intakes to cardiovascular
benefits started to come to light in 2004 with the landmark Rotterdam
Study, which showed that high dietary intake of vitamin K2—but not
vitamin K1—has a strong protective effect on cardiovascular health.
Findings from this ten-year population-based study indicated that eating
foods rich in natural vitamin K2 (at least 32 mcg/day) resulted in 50%
reduction of arterial calcification, 50% reduction of cardiovascular
risk, and 25% reduction of all-cause mortality. In 2009, these findings
were confirmed by another population-based study with 16,000 subjects
(ranging in age from 49 to 70) from the Prospect-EPIC cohort population.
After following female participants for up to eight years, the
researchers found that for every 10 mcg vitamin K2 (MK-7, MK-8, and
MK-9) consumed—again, not vitamin K1—the risk of coronary heart disease
was reduced by 9%. The American Health Association published a
population study that evaluated vitamin K status in 835 randomly
recruited Flemish individuals. Researchers observed that higher vitamin
K was associated with lower pulse wave velocity, central pressure,
forward pulse wave, and backward pulse wave. Stiffening and
calcification of the large arteries are forerunners of cardiovascular
complications. The 2015 Knapen study provides solid evidence that, in
addition to prevention, vitamin K2 can reverse existing levels of
calcification and restore arterial flexibility. Among participants with
an elevated arterial stiffness at baseline, this study demonstrated a
significant decrease in stiffness among the MK-7 test group after three
years (at

the control group. The MK-7 group demonstrated a restoration of arterial
elasticity and flexibility—essentially the return of the circularity
system to a previous state or degree of health (see Chapters 5 and 19
and Figure 21.1).

Aged Garlic: Kyolic Garlic Cardiovascular Formulation Aged garlic
(Kyolic garlic) extract has been proven to have beneficial effects in
the prevention of CHD, as well as lowering blood pressure and serum
lipids and cholesterol. Aged garlic reduces coronary calcium and plaque
progression and plaque volume in humans in those on statins and in those
not on statins. In a trial of 23 patients over one year, consuming aged
garlic at 4 grams per day, the CAC was slowed significantly. The
garlic-treated patients increased CAC only 7.5% but the placebo-treated
patients increased CAC by 22.2%. There was a high correlation with
oxidative stress, ox LDL, Lp (a), and vascular dysfunction with the
change in the CAC. Also aged garlic with B vitamins, folate, and
arginine retarded coronary atherosclerosis reducing progression CAC of
6.8% vs 26.5% with placebo that was significant at p=0.005. In the FAITH
Trial, garlic and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) evaluated the effects on vascular
elasticity and endothelial function. Sixty-five firefighters in Los
Angeles were given aged garlic at 300 mg a day with CoQ10 at 30 mg per
day vs a placebo for 12 months. The pulse wave velocity (PWV)
significantly decreased by 1.21 m/s (vascular elasticity) (p &lt;
0.005), and endothelial function improved in the treated group
significantly (p&lt; 0.01). In a recent study in 2020, 104 patients were
randomized with 46 in the active group given aged garlic at 2400 mg
daily for one year and 47 in the placebo group. There was a significant
(p &lt; 0.05) change in CAC progression. blood glucose and IL-6 in favor
of the active group. There was also a significant (p = 0.027) decrease
in systolic blood pressure in the aged garlic group. See Chapters 5 and
19. There are many active ingredients in garlic, such as Allicin,
Ajoene, S allyl cysteine which provide the following mechanisms of
action: • Reduces vascular muscle enlargement and vascular stiffness and
augmentation index. • Reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, HS-CRP,
and TNF alpha which are blood markers for inflammation. • Lowers blood
pressure. • Improves lipids, lowers LDL, increases HDL, and decreases ox
LDL. • Prevents entry of lipids into arterial wall and macrophages to
help reduce plaque formation especially low-attenuation plaque (LAP)
volumes. • Decreases endothelial damage and improves endothelial
dysfunction. • Increases nitric oxide. • Improves the microcirculation.
• Reduces platelet aggregation and adhesion to reduce clotting. •
Increases antioxidant defense with glutathione superoxide dismutase and
(SOD).

Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of fat the human body
cannot make on its own. However, they are an essential fat, which means
they are needed to survive and assure good health. We get omega-3 fatty
acids from our foods. The human body can make most of the types of fats
it needs from other fats or raw materials. That is not the case for
omega-3 fatty acids. These are essential fats that come from fish,
vegetable oils, nuts (especially walnuts), flax seeds, flaxseed oil,
algae, and leafy vegetables. They are an integral part of all cell
membranes throughout the body and affect the function of the cell
receptors in these membranes. They provide the starting point for making
hormones that regulate blood clotting, contraction and relaxation of
artery walls, and inflammation. They also bind to receptors in cells
that regulate genetic function. Likely due to these effects, omega-3
fats have been shown to help prevent and treat all types of heart
disease, especially CHD and stroke, and other health conditions. Omega-3
fats are a key family of polyunsaturated fats. There are three main
omega-3s: • Eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) come mainly from fish, so they
are sometimes called marine omega-3s. • Docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) come
mainly from fish, so they are sometimes called marine omega-3s. •
Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the most common omega-3 fatty acid in most
Western diets, is found in vegetable oils and nuts (especially walnuts),
flax seeds and flaxseed oil, leafy vegetables, and some animal fat,
especially in grass-fed animals. The human body generally uses ALA for
energy, and conversion into EPA and DHA is very limited. The conversion
from ALA to EPA and DHA may be only 5%. This conversion requires several
enzymes and many nutrients. Cofactor deficiencies in magnesium or
vitamin B6 or interfering substances or conditions such as alcohol,
trans fats, saturated fats, high omega-6 FA, obesity, insulin
resistance, and DM will decrease the conversion to EPA and DHA. It is
important to increase the anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids in the
diet and reduce the inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids. (See Figure 21.2
below.) Numerous published clinical research shows that omega-3 fatty
acids can improve your cardiovascular health and especially reduce CHD
and MI. Most of this research involves EPA + DHA, but ALA may also have
some cardiovascular benefits. In 25 studies of 280,000 patients, there
is an inverse association between fish consumption, omega-3 FA, and
morbidity and mortality from CHD. They also reduce vascular
inflammation.

FIGURE 21.2 Omega-3 pathway and the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA.
Linoleic acid: 18:2 n-6 found in nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, like corn,
sunflower, safflower, canola, and soybean oil. Alpha linolenic acid:
18:3 n-3 found in seeds of flax, rape, perilla, walnuts, chia, and
chloroplasts of leafy green vegetables. It takes five enzymes for
conversion from ALA or linoleic acid to EPA or AA: 3 desaturases (6, 5,
and 4) and 2 elongases. Enzymes are the same for both n-3 and n-6
conversion.

The Cardiovascular Benefits of Omega-3 Fatty Acids The benefits of
omega-3 fatty acids are: • • • • • • • • • • •

Reduced risk of all cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis.
Improves angina. Prevention and treatment of CHD and MI. Reduced risk of
death if you have cardiovascular disease. Reduced risk of sudden cardiac
death caused by an abnormal heart rhythm such as ventricular tachycardia
or ventricular fibrillation and improved heart rate variability.
Improves parasympathetic tone and reduces sympathetic nervous system
activity. Reduced risk of blood clots because omega-3 fatty acids help
prevent blood platelets from clumping together. Improves endothelial
dysfunction and increases nitric oxide. Improves arterial elasticity,
augmentation index, and pulse wave velocity. Reduces plaque from forming
in the coronary arteries. Reduces plaque rupture and reduces the size of
the lipid-rich core. Reduces coronary artery calcium (CAC) score.

Clinical Research Studies In this meta-analysis, there were many
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (93,000 subjects) and prospective
cohort studies (732,000 subjects) examining EPA+DHA from foods or
supplements and CHD, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac
death, coronary death, and angina in primary and secondary prevention.
Among RCTs, there was a 6% reduction in CHD risk with EPA+DHA treatment.
A subgroup analysis of data from RCTs indicated a statistically 14–16%
significant CHD risk reduction with EPA+DHA treatment among higher-risk
populations, including participants with elevated triglyceride (TG)
levels over 150 mg/dL and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
above 130 mg/dL. Meta-analysis of data from prospective cohort studies
resulted in a statistically 18% significant reduction in CHD for higher
intakes of EPA+DHA over one gram per day and risk of any CHD event.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) was reduced by 47%. In patients with high TG
over 150 mg/dL and a higher dose of omega-3 FA over one gram per day
there was a reduction of CHD by 25%. • Dart Study. 30% reduction in
total and CHD mortality in men with previous MI over two years with
fatty fish twice a week at 200–400 grams (500–800 mg n-3 FA). • Gissi
Study. Decrease in all-cause mortality (28%), CV mortality (30%), CHD
mortality (28%), and sudden death (47%) within four months with one gram
omega-3 FA in 11,000 patients with recent MI. No change in CVA or
nonfatal MI. • Kupoio Heart Study. Men in the highest quartile vs lowest
quartile had a 44% reduction in fatal and nonfatal CHD. • Jelis Study.
18% reduction in CHD events in patients already on a statin with or
without preexisting CHD, especially in those with preexisting CHD with
high TG, low HDL or hyperglycemia by 19% on 1.8 grams of EPA. • Cohort
study of over 50,000 patients 30% lowered risk of MI in men but not
women over eight years in the highest quintile vs lowest quintile. •
GISSI Heart Failure (CHF) study: reduction in sudden death in ischemic
and non-ischemic moderate to severe CHF by 9% to 20% on one gram omega-3
FA for four years. • Meta-analysis of cohort studies and clinical trials
with low dose EPA and DHA 250 mg per day reduced the risk of fatal CHD
by 36%. • Meta-analysis of 5 prospective cohort studies showed that the
risk of fatal CHD was 21% lower among subjects with a high intake of ALA
vs low intake of ALA.

• Meta-analysis of 17 prospective studies of 315,812 subjects over 16
years showed a 16% reduction in CHD and sudden death. • Reduce PCTA and
stent re-stenosis in low doses and reduce angina and MI. • Reduce CABG
graft occlusion after one year of 3–4 grams of omega-3 FA. • Japanese
have less atherosclerotic plaque burden consuming 8–15 times more
omega-3 fatty acids than the US population. • Plaque stabilizing effect.
Incorporation of omega-3 FA into carotid plaque within 42 days reduced
the number of macrophages and a plaque morphology that suggested
increased stability and reduced plaque progression. • Coronary artery
plaque prevention and regression and CAC stabilization and reduction.

Safety of Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids are safe and have very
few adverse effects from the recommended daily dose of 1000–5000 mg per
day in divided doses twice per day. Supplementation of less than 4 grams
per day when co-prescribed with antiplatelet and anticoagulants are not
associated with an increased risk of major or minor bleeding episodes.
Ten grams EPA equals 320 mg ASA for bleeding risk. The very low risk of
possible atrial fibrillation remains controversial and may be limited to
very special populations or poor-quality omega-3 fatty acids. These
studies and analyses need more verification. This is not a reason to
avoid omega-3 FA.

Dose, Ingredients, and Quality The ingredients and relative components
of the omega-3 fatty acid supplement should be as follows: The EPA to
DHA ratio should be 3:2. The gamma linolenic acid (GLA) dose should be
at 50% of the total dose of DHA and EPA (1:2 ratio). The gamma/delta
tocopherol at 100 mg per 1000 mg DHA/EPA/GLA with no more than 20% as
alpha tocopherol. GLA converts to DGLA which is anti-inflammatory. GLA
depletes DHA and EPA. EPA and DHA deplete GLA. The Omega-3 index of 8%
or higher has been reported to be associated with the greatest
cardioprotection. Omega-3 index of less than 4% gives the least
cardioprotection. The best supplement with these ingredients is EFA Sirt
Supreme: 3–5 capsules twice per day with food (from Biotics Research).

Curcumin Turmeric is a spice that has received much interest from both
the medical and scientific worlds as well as from the culinary world. It
is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant (Curcuma longa) of the
ginger family. The medicinal properties of turmeric, the source of
curcumin, have been known for thousands of years. It has antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties.

Curcumin, a polyphenol, has been shown to target multiple signaling
molecules while also demonstrating activity at the cellular level, which
has helped to support its multiple health benefits. It has been shown to
benefit CHD, kidney function, inflammatory conditions, metabolic
syndrome, pain, and arthritis. Most of these benefits are due to its
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Despite its reported benefits
via inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms, one of the major problems
with ingesting curcumin by itself is its poor bioavailability, which
appears to be primarily due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and
rapid elimination. Piperine, a known bioavailability enhancer, is the
major active component of black pepper and is associated with an
increase of 2000% in the bioavailability of curcumin. Therefore, the
issue of poor bioavailability appears to be resolved by adding agents
such as piperine that enhance bioavailability, thus creating a curcumin
complex. The cardiovascular and other health benefits of curcumin are as
follows: • Decreases proinflammatory cytokines during CABG procedures. •
Decreases cardiomyocytic apoptosis (death) after cardiac injury or MI. •
Reduces MI post-CABG from 30% to 13% at 4 grams per day given three days
before and five days after CABG. • The administration of curcumin 45 mg
dose daily for seven days prior to percutaneous angioplasty PCA until 48
hours post-PCA is useful in reducing inflammatory response post-PCA with
stable CHD. • Decreases HS-CRP, inflammation, and oxidative stress
markers. • Reduces the expression and activity of metalloproteinases,
such as MMP-2 and MMP-9, which can increase the risk of CHD and plaque
rupture. • Membrane stabilizing effect on the cardiac muscle. • Inhibits
platelet activation. • Improves endothelial dysfunction. • Improves
vascular muscle stiffness and thickening. • Decreases PWV. • Increases
adiponectin and lowers leptin, which are blood markers to improve
diabetes. • Improves insulin resistance. • Lowers TG, LDL, and increases
HDL. • Lowers blood uric acid. • Decreases visceral and total body fat.
See Chapters 5 and 19. Curcumin is very safe with minimal adverse
effects. There is no toxicity at doses of 10 grams per day. The
recommended and best-absorbed Curcumin supplements are Curcumin RX 2
twice per day (from Biotics Research), Curcumin Evail 2 twice per day
(from Designs for Health) or Turvia 2 twice per day (from Ortho
Molecular). See the Sources section at end of this book.

Quercetin, a flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables, has unique
biological properties that may improve CHD and other cardiovascular
problems. It also has other properties including anticarcinogenic,
anti-inflammatory (lowers HS-CRP), antiviral, antioxidant, and has the
ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation, platelet aggregation, and
capillary permeability, and stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis.
Quercetin (25 mg/kg) administered to rabbits on a high cholesterol diet
had reduced progression and increased regression of atherosclerosis. It
lowers the oxidative stress substance called myeloperoxidase (MPO),
increases the removal of LDL cholesterol from cells called reverse
cholesterol transport (RCT), and increases paraoxonase 2 (PON 2), which
improves HDL function and decreases the oxidation of LDL. In addition,
quercetin will improve endothelial function and increase nitric oxide,
lower blood pressure, and decrease platelet aggregation and thrombosis.
Exercise endurance is enhanced. There is an increase in muscle
mitochondria in humans. Quercetin may slow aging by blocking senescence
proteins. Fruits and vegetables are the primary dietary sources of
quercetin, particularly citrus fruits, apples, onions, parsley, sage,
tea, and red wine. Olive oil, grapes, dark cherries, and dark berries
such as blueberries, blackberries, and bilberries are also high in
quercetin and other flavonoids. The recommended dose is 500 mg twice per
day as Quercetin with nettles (from Designs for Health). See the Sources
section.

Coenzyme Q10 Ubiquinone (CoQ10) (oxidized form) and ubiquinol (CoQ10H2)
(reduced form of Coenzyme Q10) are essential for optimal cellular
function and production of ATP by the electron transport chain (ETC), a
carrier of electrons and protons, in all human cells. CoQ10 is a
fat-soluble molecule (benzoquinone with 10 units in an isoprenoid side
chain) that is found primarily in the mitochondria, but also in serum
lipoproteins and cell membranes. The clinical use in cardiovascular
disease includes hypertension, endothelial function, coronary heart
disease (CHD), myocardial infarction (MI), and systolic and diastolic
congestive heart failure (CHF). Absorption, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug
Depletions CoQ10 is poorly absorbed unless combined in a lipid-soluble
or emulsified environment or delivery system. It declines with age and
is lower in patients that exercise or have high oxidative stress,
cancer, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, or CHF. Many drugs deplete
CoQ10, such as statins, beta blockers, diuretics, and metformin. The
ability to convert to ubiquinone may also be impaired in DM, advanced
CHF, and with certain genetic SNPs (NQ01 gene) . The optimal COQ 10
level is about 2–3 µmol/L, but in advanced CVD, levels of 3 µmol/L or
greater are recommended. However, there may be a discrepancy between
actual intracellular and mitochondrial levels and serum levels due to
intracellular transport problems. Thus, a normal serum

level may not reflect reduced intracellular or reduced mitochondrial
levels. Intracellular levels of C0Q 10 should be measured in these cases
using micronutrient testing. CoQ10 is synthesized via acetyl CoA as
shown below into the all trans geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate pathway
(GGPP). Statins inhibit the HMG-COA reductase enzyme and reduce the
downstream metabolites into the GGPP pathway and thus lower CoQ10. This
may result in myalgias, myopathy, severe fatigue, oxidative stress,
inflammation, vascular immune dysfunction, and clinical cardiovascular
diseases, such as hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, CHD, and CHF.
See Figure 21.3. Clinical Physiology and Functions CoQ10 is involved in
numerous body functions. It is an antioxidant and is involved in DNA
synthesis, lysosomal function, gene expression, mitochondrial protein
uncoupling, mitochondrial permeability, mitochondrial ETC (electron
transport chain) and ATP production, membrane function, reduction of
lipid peroxidation and reduction of oxLDL, apoptosis, and recycling of
other micronutrients especially tocopherols and vitamin C. The ETC
complex 1–4 on the inner mitochondrial membrane produces ATP via
electron transport with CoQ10 involvement particularly at Complex 1 and
2 (Figure 21.4). Cardiovascular Disease: CHF, CHD, Angina, and MI The
heart uses about 6 million mg of ATP per day at normal heart rates of
60–70 beats per minute. This is more than any other organ and is about
20–30 times its own

weight. The loss of ATP results in diastolic dysfunction, followed by
LAH, LVH, and systolic CHF, with low ejection fraction (EF). The primary
energy sources for the heart are: Free fatty acids: 60% or more
Carbohydrates: Glucose 35% or less Amino acids and ketone bodies: 5% The
heart is different from most organs as it prefers FA to glucose for
energy. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the most important events in
the development of CHF, which explains the importance of CoQ10 in the
mitochondrial ETC and ATP production. The metabolic pathways with
glycolysis, TCA cycle, ETC, and final conversion to contractile energy
are shown below with the importance of glucose, free fatty acids, the
carnitine shuttle, beta oxidation, ETC production of ATP, then creatine
kinase and the phosphocreatine shuttle for cardiac myocyte
contractility. The three important parts of cardiac energy production
are: • Energy Substrate Utilization: Energy from food, uptake of glucose
and FFA by cardiac myocyte then breakdown by glycolysis, Krebs cycle
(TCA) and beta oxidation with the production of ATP. • Oxidative
Phosphorylation (ETC): Mitochondria and ATP production. • ATP transfer
and utilization: Creatine kinase and phosphocreatine energy shuttle,
actomyosin ATPase in myofibril, Ca-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum and
Na-K ATPase in sarcolemma. See Figure 21.5 (CHART 1).

Reduced levels of CoQ10 are an independent risk predictor of increased
mortality in CHF, CHD, and MI patients. CoQ10 improves angina, CHD,
diastolic dysfunction, CHF, and ventricular arrhythmia. CoQ10 improves
endothelial dysfunction and mitochondrial function in patients with
ischemic LV systolic CHF within eight weeks. CoQ10 improves functional
abnormalities on ECHO, increases EF, improves clinical symptoms, and
enhances overall cardiac function. . These clinical effects are related
to its antioxidant activity, protection of membrane phospholipids and
the mitochondrial membrane protein, reduction in oxidative stress
increases in oxidative defenses with SOD and catalase, lowering of LDL
oxidation NT-proBNP, cell adhesion molecules, and IL-6 and increasing in
HDL-C. CoQ10 reduced post-MI reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias,
improved LV function and total cardiac death. In a DBRPC trial of 144
subjects with acute MI, CoQ10 at 120 mg per day administered within the
first three days of an MI resulted in significant improvements in the
treated group in all parameters (p &lt; 0.05). • Angina (9.5% vs 25.3%).
• Arrhythmias (9.5% vs 25.3%).

• LVF improved (8.2 vs 22.5%). • Total cardiac events and death reduced
at 15% vs 30.9% (P &lt; 0.02).

In patients with acute MI, COQ10 administration at 200 mg per day over
12 weeks had higher HDL, lower LDL, lower fibrinogen, and lower BP
compared to the placebo group. These risk factor improvements would
reduce future risk for MI. CoQ10 pretreatment with 100–300 mg per day
for 7–14 days prior to CABG improved shortterm outcome measures. Several
placebo-controlled trials in patients with chronic stable angina
demonstrated improved exercise tolerance and reduced or delayed EKG
changes of myocardial ischemia in the CoQ10 treated group. A
meta-analysis of eight and 11 randomized trials over —one to six months
showed significantly increased LVEF and CO . In a study over four weeks,
in patients with moderate to severe CHF, administration of COQ 10 at 300
mg/day improved significantly the LV contractility and peak VO2. CoQ10
also increased peak VO2 vs placebo (p &lt; 0.05). CoQ10 reverses
statin-induced diastolic dysfunction and improves systolic and diastolic
dysfunction, endothelial function, and mitochondrial function at 300 mg
per day within eight weeks. In a DBPC study, 641 patients with CHF,
CoQ10 reduced hospitalization by 20% vs placebo. Published clinical
trials with 395 patients, from 1985 to 2005 in which 79% of the subjects
were men, ages 50–68, conducted over 4–28 weeks demonstrated impressive
results. • Ejection fraction (EF) increased from 22% to 46% and NYHA
class from 2.3 to 3.4. • Pooled net change of 3.67% in EF (−3.0% to
17.8%) and improved NYHA functional class (CI 1.60 to 5.74%) • Best
increase in EF was in those with EF over 30%. • Baseline Coq10 was
.61–1.01 µg/ml which increased 1.4 µg/ml in most of the studies at doses
of CoQ10 of 60–300 mg/d. The ideal blood level is 2–3ug/ ml but this was
achieved in only three studies. If all studies had achieved the optimal
serum levels, the results would have likely been much better. The
Q–SYMBIO Trial of CoQ10 and CHF is the most important of all the studies
yet published on CoQ10 and heart failure. A summary of the results of
this study are shown below: • Randomized trial of 420 patients with
moderate to severe CHF defined as NYHA class 3 and 4 over ten years. • 2
mg/kg CoQ10 per day (100 mg tid) vs placebo plus standard therapy.
Increased serum COQ 10 levels three times. • Primary short-term
endpoints: NYHA function class, six-minute walk test, NT-pro BNP. No
difference between groups. No significant change in EF. • Reduced MACE
(major adverse cardiac events) by 43% (p = 0.003 CI: 32–80) and
all-cause mortality 42% (major adverse cardiovascular events:

mortality by 50% (p = 0.01) and CHF.

Hypertension and Endothelial Function CoQ10 is very effective in
lowering blood pressure and improving endothelial function. It reduces
SVR and BP which correlates with an increase in serum CoQ-10 level (↑
.97 µg/ml) (p &lt;0.02) compared to pretreatment CoQ10 levels. Office BP
reductions average 17/10 mm Hg and the 24-hour ABM decreases 18/10 mm Hg
(p &lt; 0.001). In a meta-analysis of 12 trials with 362 patients, the
range in BP reduction was 11–17/8–10 mm Hg. Therapeutic plasma levels
are 3.0 ng/ml. The heart rate decreased five beats per minute. The BP
effects occur at 4–12 weeks and are gone at 7–10 days after
discontinuation. There is a deficiency of Co Enzyme Q-10 in 39% of
hypertensive patients vs 6% of control patients. CoQ10 is reduced with
age, disease, oxidative stress, statins, HLP, CHD, HBP, DM, aerobic
exercise, and atherosclerosis. The administration of CoQ10 reduces the
dose and number of BP medications. The best BP reduction occurs with the
lowest initial CO-Q-10. In a 12-week R, DB placebo-controlled trial of
83 men and women with systolic hypertension (165/81–82 mm Hg) were given
60 MG CO-Q-10 bid. The serum levels increased by 2.2 µg/ml. The SBP fell
18 mm Hg (P &lt; 0.01) and the DBP fell 2.6 mm Hg. Patients administered
Co10 with enalapril improved 24-hour BP better than enalapril
monotherapy and normalized endothelial dysfunction. In older mice, CoQ10
improved NO bioavailability normalized superoxide production and
oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine abundance), as well as with increases in
markers of vascular mitochondrial health, including antioxidant status.
It also reversed the age-related increase in endothelial susceptibility
to acute mitochondrial damage. This study and others indicate that
preservation of vascular endothelial function with advancing age may
prevent of age-related CVD. In a placebo-controlled trial in diabetic
patients over 12 weeks, CoQ10 at 200 mg per day improved EDV
(endothelial-dependent vasodilation). Patients on statins also have
improved EDV when given CoQ10 at 200 mg per day for 12 weeks. A
meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials with 194 subjects
found that CoQ10 at 150 to 300 mg per day for 4–12 weeks improved EDV by
1.7%.

SUMMARY CoQ10 improves endothelial function, lowers BP, reduces CHF
morbidity and mortality, improves CHD, angina, and MI. It may be used in
conjunction with other drugs and supplements to enhance efficacy. Doses
of CoQ10 should be adjusted to both serum levels and intra-cellular
levels to achieve optimal cardiovascular improvement. CoQ10 is safe even
at high doses. The recommended dose is 200 mg per day of COQNOL (from
Designs for Health). The optimal COQ 10 level is about 3 µmol/L. See the
Sources section at the end of this book.

Mito Q is an enhanced form of COQ10 that has been engineered to enter
the heart mitochondria at significant levels. No other antioxidant, CO Q
10, or form of CO Q 10 can do this as effectively. Once inside the
mitochondria, the production of ATP is increased, heart muscle functions
better and there is improvement in CHD and CHF. MitoQ improves cardiac
enlargement and remodeling, fibrosis, LV dysfunction, and dysregulation
of RNAs in pressure-overloaded hearts. I have seen patients with a
marked reduction in anginal chest pain, improvement in the cardiac
ejection fraction, improved CHF symptoms, reduction in diastolic
dysfunction, and improved energy and exercise levels.

for medical clearance with a history, physical exam, and cardiopulmonary
exercise testing. This ensures that you do not have heart disease, CHD,
angina-marked elevations in blood pressure with exercise, or other
contraindications to an exercise program. Then the exercise should be
slowly progressive until training is achieved. You should do a
combination of aerobic training (AT) and resistance training (RT) for at
least 60 minutes per day at least six days per week to reduce
cardiovascular risk and lower blood pressure. The aerobic exercises
should be for 20 minutes per day up to 60–80% of maximal aerobic
capacity (MAC) for age: MAC = MHR (maximal heart rate) = (220−age).
Resistance training should be for 40 minutes per day alternating muscle
groups each day such as upper or lower body exercises. Resistance
training should be progressive, initially with lighter weights to avoid
elevations in blood pressure, if not done under supervision. Progressive
resistance training under supervision will reduce CHD risk, CHD risk
factors, improve lean muscle mass, insulin sensitivity, lowers glucose,
improves serum lipids and cholesterol, and reduces blood pressure.
Exercise increases nitric oxide, improves endothelial function,
increases coronary artery blood flow, improves angina with time and
training, dilates arteries, and reduces inflammation. Table 21.1 shows
various exercises that you can do and the number of kilocalories burned
(kilocalorie = 1000 calories). Skeletal muscle (all of the muscles of
your body) is a secretory/endocrine organ and exercise increases the
metabolic and secretory/endocrine capacity of muscle (1). Specific kinds
of exercise can alter the ways that genes function and how they interact
with cells (1). By triggering the right exercise–gene interactions,
inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune dysfunction are improved. (1)

is not inevitable. It is largely the result of diet and movement—or the
lack thereof. Movement is one of the primary keys to overall health and
especially cardiovascular health. The movement required is the same kind
of natural movement that has kept humans in robust physical health for
millennia. This is not the kind of exercise that most personal trainers,
fitness enthusiasts, or doctors recommend. As a matter of fact, most
doctors and trainers recommend the exact opposite approach to movement
and exercise, one that may actually accelerate the deterioration of
health, cardiovascular benefits, and overall aging. There is an optimal
type and duration of exercise that is required to improve health. It is
important to avoid the overtraining syndrome which actually increases
muscle breakdown, elevates cortisol levels and increases sympathetic
tone, increases oxidative stress and inflammation, and results in the
opposite effects that one desires. The power of exercise relates to the
numerous hormones, mediators, and signaling molecules that lower blood
pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol which are released with the
proper type of exercise that influences genes, inflammation, oxidative
stress, and immune function and reduces the risk of CHD and MI. The ABCT
exercise program is a modern way of exercising the way our ancestors
did. The program is specifically designed to get the muscles and body
moving in short burns of intense activity, mixing anaerobic with just
enough aerobic exercise to improve cardiovascular health, CHD, overall
health, and conditioning (1). In addition, proper nutrition is
emphasized before, during, and after exercise training. The ABCT
exercise program has numerous positive effects on the body and mind. The
ABCT exercise program is simple, effective, scientifically proven, and
adaptable to everyone’s exercise needs. It allows for optimal training
benefits in a shorter period of time to build and tone muscle, reduce
body and visceral fat, lose weight, improve hormone levels, lower
inflammation and oxidation, decrease blood sugar, reduce blood pressure,
improve the lipid profile, decrease CHD, improve one’s quality of life,
increase life expectancy and slow the aging process. In addition, this
type of exercise avoids overtraining associated with increased cortisol
levels and catabolic effects.

The ABCs of Exercise with a Twist The most efficient and effective means
of achieving all the health benefits of exercise is to combine interval
aerobic training (AE) with anaerobic or resistance exercise or training
(RT), in a way that causes body restoration and proper muscle growth and
efficiency. The ABCT (aerobics, build, contour, and tone) exercise
program is designed for both genders and allows for specific outcomes.
It has additional meanings that help define its goals: • A = Aerobics
plus action and adaptation. The program focuses on the types of action
best suited for muscle and cardiovascular conditioning to adapt to new
exercises, so muscles do not accommodate to the same daily training. • B
= Build, plus bulk, burn, and breathe. The program builds and increases
muscle strength more than any other exercise regimen while learning to

use muscle burn to the best advantage with proper breathing to increase
oxygen consumption and eliminate carbon dioxide to improve
cardiovascular and muscle conditioning and function while reducing
muscle or chronic fatigue. • C = Contour, plus core and controlling your
genes. Muscular exercise regulates the expression of more than 400 genes
that mediate the beneficial effects of physical activity. In addition to
aerobics and resistance exercise, this program will combine core
exercises that improve abdominal and back muscle strength as well as
exercises for flexibility and balance. • T = Tone, plus trim and tight.
Total body fat, visceral body fat, and body weight are decreased while
lean muscle mass increases.

The ABCT exercise program emphasizes interval aerobic and anaerobic
resistance movements. Proper warm-up and stretching before beginning
every exercise session and cooling down and stretching again when
finished are mandatory to avoid muscle, tendon, and ligament injuries
while promoting the flexibility that is necessary for exercising. Before
embarking on an exercise program of any kind or changing the exercise
regimen you already have a complete history, physical exam, labs,
cardiovascular risk factor analysis, and cardiopulmonary exercise test
are suggested. Interval training with rapid bursts of activity may
precipitate plaque rupture in a coronary artery in some predisposed
individuals and result in myocardial infarction.

The Elements of ABCT The main elements of ABCT, each of which will be
discussed in more detail below, are: • Resistance Training.
Weight-lifting modified properly encourages optimal muscle physiology
and the release of hormones, mediators, and interleukins. ABCT uses
graduated weights and variable repetitions. In brief, initially lift the
heaviest weight possible twelve times to get the muscle burn, then
decrease the weight with each subsequent set, but keep increasing the
number of times that weight is lifted. This maximizes post-exercise
oxygen consumption, depletes glycogen, and increases the production of
lactic acid to achieve all the muscle-, hormone-, cytokine-, and
interleukin-stimulating effects that lead to the health benefits of
exercise. • Aerobic Training in Intervals. Jogging, swimming, biking,
and other forms of continual movement should be done at specific levels
of submaximal and maximal aerobic capacity (MAC) or estimated heart rate
for age and level of exercise (MHR). The best technique is aerobic
interval training, which consists of short periods ranging from twenty
seconds to two minutes of “burst” aerobic training of varying
intensities, depending on one’s present level of exercise conditioning.
This more closely mimics the natural activities we evolved to perform
and benefit from and strings together several

periods of intense and semi-intense activity into a single, longer
exercise period that still burns calories and builds endurance. Proper
Ratio of Aerobic Training to Resistance Training. The optimal ratio of
resistance to interval aerobic training should be 2:1. For example,
during a 60-minute workout, you would perform 40 minutes of resistance
training and 20 minutes of interval aerobics, with the aerobics coming
after the resistance training. Core Exercises. Exercises designed to
improve abdominal and back strength while increasing flexibility. These
exercises are important for the core (abdomen and lower back), which is
often neglected. Time-Intense Exercise. Rather than methodically working
one muscle or muscle group after another, then doing the aerobic
exercises—or even saving the aerobics for the next day—ABCT challenges
the body by combining exercises as much as possible. For example,
instead of doing leg squats followed by shoulder presses, with ABCT they
are done at the same time, mimicking real-life movements. Busy Rest
Periods. These are used to insert small bursts of aerobic exercises into
the resistance training period. Water and the ABCT Energy Shake.
Drinking plenty of water while working out is vital. (If you get thirsty
during the workout, you have waited too long to drink.) You must drink
water before beginning to exercise, at set intervals during exercise,
and afterward. Your water should be of high quality and not from plastic
containers, due to the risk of certain chemical compounds like PCBs that
get into the water from the plastic. In addition, about ten minutes
after starting your workout, you begin consuming an energy drink
consisting of fresh orange juice (4 ounces) and water (6 ounces),
d-ribose (5 grams), and whey protein (30 grams) to provide ATP and
energy as well as nutritional substrates to maximize exercise
performance and increase muscle strength and performance as well as lean
muscle mass (1, 14–24). Exercise in the Morning. Exercising in the
morning after a 12-hour fast is best for numerous reasons, including the
fact that an empty stomach optimizes fat burning and interleukin 10
(IL-10), which lowers inflammation but increases the myokine surges.
This results in an increase in muscle strength, bulk, tone, and contour,
as well as weight and body fat loss, and improved energy level, focus,
and concentration during the day. Exercise on an Empty Stomach. Begin
exercising on an empty stomach after a 12-hour fast, except for water
and whey protein consumed about ten minutes before exercise, and have
nothing but more water and energy drink while exercising. This allows
for the depletion of liver and muscle glycogen while generating maximal
surges of IL-10. It also increases fat burning and accelerates weight
and fat loss from both inside and outside the skeletal muscle. Push and
Rest. Exercise to maximal effort during each set until “the burn” is
significant. The burn should be severe and last for about four to

five seconds after you stop the exercise. Then rest for 60 seconds
before beginning the next set of exercises. You may take three-second
rest periods between repetitions, if necessary. Also performing
supersets with minimal rest between sets of exercises or using the rest
period for core exercises or alternative upper or lower body exercises
will improve the time intensity of the exercise session. • Exercise
Daily, Utilizing Cross-Training. To achieve the best results, perform
interval aerobic and resistance training at least six days per week or,
if desired, every day but alternate the muscle groups for the upper and
lower body as well as the type of aerobic exercise performed. It is
important to change the exercise routine every few weeks to avoid
“muscle accommodation” to the exercise regimen. • Breathe. Mastering
proper breathing techniques will ensure ample oxygenation for muscle
performance, as well as prompt the removal of carbon dioxide.

The ABCT Elements in Detail Resistance Training ABCT resistance training
takes a radically different approach, mixing heavier weights and lower
repetitions with lower weights and greater repetitions to increase the
lactic acid burn as well as to maximize muscle contractions and the
release of muscle enzymes (myokines). With ABCT, the real goal is not
only to bulk and contour the muscles but to use muscle movements to
improve body biochemistry and improve blood pressure, cardiovascular
health, and overall health. ABCT resistance training is based on five
sets, each with a different number of repetitions in each set. Here’s
the ABCT Five-Set Schedule that starts with the heaviest weight with low
repetitions and advances to lighter weight with increasing repetitions.
• • • • •

ABCT Set 1: 12 repetitions at maximum weight. ABCT Set 2: 18 repetitions
at 75 percent of maximum weight. ABCT Set 3: 24 repetitions at 50
percent of maximum weight. ABCT Set 4: 50 repetitions at 25 percent of
maximum weight. ABCT Set 5: 12 repetitions at maximum weight.

ABCT Five-Set schedule should be phased in slowly to avoid injury or
excessive fatigue, depending on one’s present level of physical
conditioning. • • • •

Beginners: ABCT 1, or ABCT 1 and 2. Intermediate: ABCT 1, 2, and 3

This burn scale can be used as a guide to the exercise level. The idea
is to attempt to score a 5 multiple times during your workouts, stopping
only briefly (three seconds) to clear the burn before continuing again.
1—No burn in the muscle 2—Light burn 3—Moderate burn 4—Strong burn
5—Intense burn; must rest

What, How, and When to Lift Descriptions of the key ABCT resistance
exercises are found at the end of the chapter under the heading “Getting
Started with ABCT: Training Session Schedules and Descriptions of the
Lifts.”

Upping the Intensity with Supersets, Hybrids, and Rapid Sets Simply
following the ABCT 5-Set Schedule will improve blood pressure,
cardiovascular and general health. Incorporating hybrids, supersets, and
rapid sets as one gains strength and endurance will improve exercise
outcomes. • Hybrids are two exercises performed at once; i.e., do a full
leg squat while also performing an overhead press. Using more muscles
simultaneously increases the burn, lactic acid, release of IL-10, and
post-exercise oxygen consumption. • Supersets are exercises done
back-to-back, with almost no rest period between (fifteen seconds
maximum). These can be the same exercise, such as biceps curls
back-to-back, or different exercises, such as a biceps curl followed
immediately by a triceps lift. Supersets dramatically increase the burn
and other beneficial effects of exercise. Supersets should be done only
after one has trained for some time to avoid overuse injury or excessive
heart rate. • Rapid sets are sets performed faster than normal to
compress the workout time, enhance mechanical and metabolic burnout, and
improve both resistance and aerobic conditioning. For example, with a
biceps curl, increase the speed from one every second to two every three
seconds.

ABCT Resistance Training Hints 1. Take three-second breaks along the
way, if necessary. 2. Drink water and the ABCT energy drink after each
set of exercises. 3. Even if the number of repetitions cannot be done in
each set, attempt to push to the limit until the maximum burn occurs.

4.  If the percentage reduction in weight is a fraction of a number,
    round up to the next highest whole number on the weight system you
    are using. This may be one pound or five pounds in most systems.

Aerobic Training in Intervals Aerobic means “with oxygen” and refers to
the use of oxygen in the body’s metabolic processes. Aerobic training
consists of continuous movements that demand more oxygen consumption and
ultimately improve the body’s oxygen use. Rapid walking, jogging,
running, swimming, bicycling, dancing, and aerobics classes can all be
aerobic exercises if they keep the body in moderate to intense motion
for a moderately long period of time, with an elevated heart rate
representing the body’s heightened level of activity. For best results,
aerobic training should be broken up into periods of differing
intensities or interval training with differing lengths and intensities.
In general, the interval would be at 90% of maximum heart rate (MHR) for
a period of time followed by 50% of MHR for one to three times that
period depending on conditioning. For example, a 30-second sprint would
be followed by a 30–90-second slow jog. ONE TO THREE The ideal ratio for
aerobic interval training is 1:3. This means for every unit of time
spent exercising at 90% of your maximal heart rate, spend an additional
three units of time exercising at 50% of maximal heart rate (MHR). Then
you repeat this 1:3 sequence about six times over about 20 minutes. The
MHR calculation is shown below. For best results, an interval aerobic
exercise program should consist of a fiveminute warm-up period, followed
by moderate to intense interval training involving large and multiple
muscle groups lasting about 20 minutes, followed by a coolingdown period
of about 5 minutes at the end. Aerobic sessions should utilize
cross-training, by rotating through different aerobic activities to
improve cardiovascular and muscle performance. For example, jog or run
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; swim on Tuesday and Thursday; bike on
Saturday and Sunday.

Maximum Heart Rate and Maximum Aerobic Capacity • Maximal Heart Rate
Calculation (MHR)—220 minus age gives the maximum aerobic capacity
(MAC), and then multiply by the desired heart rate, which should range
between 50% and 90% depending on the level of exercise and age. For
example, if you are age 40 the MAC would be 220-40 or 180. If you wanted
to push to 80% of MAC then multiply 180 × .80 = 144 beats /minute as
MHR.

Always Combine Resistance and Aerobic Exercises The optimal ratio is 2
parts resistance training to one part interval aerobic training, with
the resistance training first. Here’s how the ratio works out with
differing total exercise time frames. • 15 minutes total = 10 minutes of
resistance training, 5 minutes of aerobic training. • 30 minutes total =
20 minutes of resistance training, 10 minutes of aerobic training. • 45
minutes total = 30 minutes of resistance training, 15 minutes of aerobic
training. • 60 minutes total = 40 minutes of resistance training, 20
minutes of aerobic training. Core Exercises Exercising body core, such
as the belly and lower back, increases abdominal and back strength while
improving flexibility and balance. These can be done in sets of one to
four per exercise, with the number of repetitions necessary to create
the same burn that one gets with the resistance weight training program.
Doing the core exercises during the sixty-second break periods while the
upper or lower body muscles are resting will improve the time efficiency
of the workout. Core exercises include sit-ups, abdominal crunches, leg
lifts, and leg scissor crosses, etc. Time-Intensive Exercise Two
additional steps are required to efficiently and effectively build
muscle strength, tone, and contour while simultaneously improving
cardiovascular conditioning and cardiovascular health: time-intensive
resistance exercises and combined aerobic and resistance training. 5.
Time-Intensive Resistance Exercises. Performing time-intense exercises
requires using multiple and large muscle groups simultaneously, with
minimal rest periods; for example, lifting light weights over the head
while doing deep knee bends. This increases the release of IL-10 and
other muscle cytokines, reduces inflammation, increases lactic acid
“burn”, enhances post-exercise oxygen consumption, builds muscle,
optimizes metabolic and hormonal responses, and increases fat metabolism
and fat and weight loss. 6. Combined Aerobic and Resistance Training.
Instead of standing or sitting during the sixty-second between-set rest
periods, another resistance or aerobic exercise should be done to
maintain heart rate and respiratory rate. For example, on completing an
upper body exercise, immediately start doing a lower body exercise or a
core exercise that engages large muscle groups and requires “big”
action. This technique maintains heart rate and provides more
cardiovascular and muscular conditioning

Exercise on an Empty Stomach The exercising program should begin in the
morning on an empty stomach, following an eight- to twelve-hour fast,
with the exception of drinking water and whey protein that is followed
during exercise by the ABCT Energy Drink. Consumption of carbohydrates
before exercise decreases fat burning and weight loss. Exercising on an
empty stomach burns more than twice as much fat as does exercising after
consuming carbohydrates. Exercising in a fasting state may increase the
utilization of muscle protein for energy slightly, but this effect is
relatively small and is minimized when whey protein is consumed. Optimal
exercise benefits occur when skeletal muscle and liver glycogen are
depleted. Glycogen depletion triggers the maximal release of IL-10 from
muscle, increases muscle growth and fat burning for energy, accelerates
fat loss from inside and outside muscle, and improves weight loss. All
of this, in turn, reduces inflammation by increasing the levels of IL-10
while lowering other interleukins, such as IL-1,

Nutrition, Water, and ABCT Energy Drink Nutritional macronutrient and
micronutrient intake relative to exercise is important to optimize
recovery, enhance subsequent performance, synthesize muscle (anabolism
&gt; catabolism), and provide optimal metabolic and nutrient-genetic
interaction for muscle signaling (17). During exercise, inflammation and
oxidative stress are linked via muscle metabolism and muscle damage
(18). Consumption of a carbohydrate supplement immediately after
exercise will improve insulin action and synthesize muscle glycogen
significantly faster than when the same amount of carbohydrate is
consumed two hours post-exercise (17). Protein intake and exercise have
synergistic effects on increasing the rate of muscle protein synthesis
leading to a more positive protein balance but vary depending on the
timing of the protein intake and the exercise session (17). The timing
of whole protein may not be as crucial as the timing of specific amino
acid supplements and anabolism (17). Most studies suggest that consuming
free amino acids immediately prior to exercise or within ten minutes of
the initiation of exercise is more effective to increase muscle protein
accretion compared to consumption after exercise (15, 17). In contrast,
whey protein ingestion may be consumed before, during, or after
exercise. The effects on muscle anabolism are enhanced with immediate
and simultaneous consumption post-exercise of carbohydrates and fats as
long as this occurs within less than two hours post-exercise (17).
Hydration before, during, and after the exercise program is vital. Two
types of hydration are necessary: plain water and the ABCT energy drink.
Begin the exercise program well hydrated, drinking about 6 ounces of
water. The amounts of fluids and water consumed depend on body size, the
ambient temperature, and the length and intensity of the workout. As a
rule of thumb, 24–32 ounces or more of fluid and water are needed during
the typical 60-minute workout. Whey protein supplies glutathione
precursors is anabolic with an increase in muscle mass and reduces
oxidative stress and inflammation (1, 17). The ingredients in whey help
maximize ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production, improve muscle
performance, increase muscle mass, and reduce muscle fatigue (1,17).

IL-6, and increasing the production of testosterone and growth hormone,
improving insulin sensitivity, and lowering insulin and glucose levels.
The intramuscular triglycerides are metabolized better during
glycogen-depleted exercise. The intramuscular triglycerides are far less
responsive to insulin which slows the breakdown of stored fat.
Exercising while fasting suppresses insulin levels and maximizes the
hormonal and cytokine effects of the exercise program. HORMONAL CHANGES
• Testosterone levels increase, enhancing muscle growth, mass, tone, and
contour; improving insulin sensitivity, which lowers blood sugar and
reduces the risk of diabetes and heart disease; elevating the energy
level and libido; and slowing aging. • Growth hormone levels increase,
improving muscle growth, mass, tone, and contour; improving energy;
increasing the sense of well-being; and slowing aging. • Insulin levels
decrease as a result of the improved insulin sensitivity that develops
as lean muscle mass increases. (Lean muscle accounts for about 80
percent of insulin sensitivity or resistance in humans.) These changes
help reduce intramuscular triglycerides and extramuscular fat tissue
while reducing the risk of heart disease and inflammation. • Cortisol
levels drop, improving muscle growth, lowering cholesterol and TG,
reducing blood sugar, and decreasing visceral fat which is associated
with inflammation, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance,
high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, cancer, heart disease, and
stroke.

Nutrition Before, During, and After the Exercise Session Nutrient
availability serves as a potent modulator of many acute responses and
chronic adaptations to both RT and AE. Changes in the macronutrient
intake quickly change the concentration of substrates and hormones with
alterations in the storage profile of skeletal muscle and other
insulin-sensitive organs. This, in turn, regulates gene expression and
cell signaling. Nutrient-exercise interactions activate or inhibit
biochemical pathways during training. Proper nutrition after exercise
with a breakfast containing fluids, high-quality protein, complex
carbohydrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and monounsaturated fatty acids is
essential to increase muscle mass and overall muscle performance and
cardiovascular conditioning for each subsequent exercise session. • A
small bowl of whole-grain cereal or steel-cut oats with whole milk, rice
milk, or almond milk. • ½ cup of one of the following: fresh
blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, or strawberries.

• 4 ounces fresh orange or vegetable juice or another fresh juice, such
as pomegranate, grape, or grapefruit; or have an orange, grapefruit,
grapes; or green vegetables like kale, spinach, or broccoli. • 4 ounces
of smoked salmon with lemon juice, capers, and perhaps add some hot
sauce, and jalapeño peppers. • Whole-wheat toast with omega-3 margarine
and raw honey. • One egg.

Instead of salmon, you might try tuna or other coldwater fish, lean
organic meat (buffalo, elk, venison, beef), organic chicken, or organic
turkey.

Getting Started with ABCT: Training Schedules and Descriptions of the
Lifts This section contains different training schedules, ranging from
beginner to professional levels: • Alternate days with the various
resistance programs (numbers 1–4) listed below for each of the week’s
sessions. • Vary the type of aerobic exercise: for example, running one
day, swimming the next, and bicycling the third. • Do the aerobic
exercise after the resistance exercises. • Always do the correct number
of sets with each type of ABCT session for the upper body, lower body,
core, flexibility, and balance exercises. For example, if you are doing
ABCT 1, do only one set for each exercise. With ABCT 2, do two sets for
each exercise, with ABCT 3, do three sets for each exercise, and so on.
• Customize the exercise program depending on your goals and time
commitment. If you wish to build more muscle, do ABCT 1, 2, and 5; or
ABCT 1, 2, 3, and 5. If your goal is to contour and tone, do ABCT 2, 3,
and 4. If you wish to have bulk, contour, and tone, then do ABCT 1–5.
The ABCT Training Schedules Week One: Beginning Session \#1, with ABCT 1

– 2 to 3 core exercises with selection from the following: sit-ups,
crunches, leg lifts, leg scissor crosses, leg extensions to chest. 2.
Aerobic exercise for 20 minutes.

Chest Exercises Push-up. Position yourself like a plank, on your hands
and toes. The hands should be in alignment with the chest, fingers
pointing straight forward, with the hands spaced a little wider than
shoulder-width apart. The tummy is tucked in, and the butt muscle is
down and straight, in alignment with the back. To work different areas
of the muscles, the hands can be moved further apart (more chest) or
closer together (more triceps) Primary areas worked: chest Secondary
areas worked: triceps, shoulders Bench Press. This uses the same
movement as a push-up, except you lie on your back and push a weight up
instead of raising the body. It can be done with dumbbells, a barbell,
or on a machine. It can also be done in an incline or decline position.
Primary areas worked: chest Secondary areas worked: triceps, shoulders
Dip. Best done on a “dipping bar”, where the body is suspended and
supported only by the arms. In the beginning position, the legs hang
down, the body leans slightly forward, and the arms are fully extended.
The elbows bend, and the arms lower the body down, then straighten to
raise the body back to the starting position. Primary areas worked:
chest Secondary areas worked: triceps, shoulders Chest Fly. Can be
performed using either dumbbells or a fly machine. Lie on your back on a
bench with your arms out to the sides holding weights (or gripping the
machine bars). Arc your arms up and in from the outstretched position
until they are pressed together above the chest, with arms straight out
and up. Keep a slight bend in the elbows the entire time. Get a good
stretch at the bottom of the movement and a good squeeze at the top.
Primary areas worked: chest Secondary areas worked: front deltoid Cable
Chest Fly. Done on a cable machine, standing, which each hand gripping a
handle. Stand with one leg in front of the other, leaning slightly
forward, the arms outstretched and back, with elbows slightly bent. The
arms are then pulled forward until they are aligned directly in front of
the chest.

Primary areas worked: chest Secondary areas worked: front deltoid

Back Exercises Back Row. Done with dumbbells (one or two), a barbell, or
machines. Starting lying face down on a bench, with the arms hanging
down straight and gripping the weights or the machine bars. The goal is
to pull weight up toward the body. There are many variations, including
close-grip rows performed on a pulley machine and the onearm version
done while leaning over a bench. Primary areas worked: latissimi,
rhomboids, trapezii Secondary areas worked: biceps, rear deltoid
Pullover. Begin lying face up on a bench, with the arms extended beyond
the head and down, holding the weight. Keeping the arms close together
and elbows slightly bent, bring them up over the head in an arcing
motion, then lower them back to the starting position. This is usually
done with one dumbbell, although there are variations using a barbell,
two dumbbells, or a pullover machine. Primary areas worked: latissimi
Secondary areas worked: triceps, chest Lat Pull-Down. Done using a
weight machine. While sitting on the bench, reach up to grasp the bar
and pull it down the top of the upper chest or upper back. Primary areas
worked: latissimi Secondary areas worked: biceps Dickerson. Done using
either a lateral pull-down machine or a pulley system. Begin with the
arms straight out in front of the body, slightly elevated to forehead
level. Grasp the vertical bar. Keeping the arms stiff, elbows slightly
bent and shoulder width (or a little wider apart), pull the bar down to
just above the hips. Primary areas worked: latissimi Secondary areas
worked: triceps Pull-Up. This exercise uses body weight only. It is done
hanging from a bar and pulling yourself up, or using a machine with a
counterbalanced weight bar you stand on for a little help. This is ideal
for those not yet strong enough to lift their own body weight. Primary
areas worked: latissimi Secondary areas worked: biceps

Shrug. Standing and holding on to barbells or dumbbells, “shrug” your
shoulders up toward your ears to pull the weight up. Arms remain
straight the whole time. Primary areas worked: trapezii Secondary areas
worked: none, or very minor shoulder action Shoulder Exercises Shoulder
Press. The goal of this exercise is to push a weight up over the head.
It can be done with dumbbells or barbells, or using a weight machine.
Hand position can be varied. If a barbell or machine is used, the hands
can be placed closer or farther apart on the bar. If dumbbells are used,
the palms can be facing out (forward) or each other, or changed from one
position to the other as the arms are raised. Primary areas worked:
deltoids Secondary areas worked: triceps Lateral Raise. Done with
dumbbells, one held in each hand, arms hanging down to the sides, with
the weights slightly in front of the body. The arms are raised to the
side until the elbows reach just above the shoulder level, then are
lowered back down. This exercise can be varied by keeping the elbows
slightly bent, which makes it a bit harder, or completely bent, which is
easier and safer for the shoulder joint. Primary areas worked: side
deltoids Secondary areas worked: trapezii Front Raise. Similar to the
lateral raise, performed with dumbbells or a barbell. Begin with the
weight(s) held in the hands, arms straight down in front of the body.
The arms are lifted straight out and up in front of the body in an
arcing movement, stopping just above shoulder level. Primary areas
worked: front deltoids Secondary areas worked: trapezii, chest Rear Fly.
Performed with dumbbells, with the body leaning over the legs. It can be
done either seated or standing with knees bent and leaning over. Start
with weights hanging straight down from the body, level with the
abdominal muscles. The weight is then lifted out to the side of the
body, keeping a slight bend in the elbows. Primary areas worked: rear
deltoids Secondary areas worked: rhomboids Upright Row. Done with a
barbell or two dumbbells. Begin standing, with the arms hanging down and
weights in front of the body, palms facing in toward the body. The
weight is lifted up to just below chin level, with the elbows kept high
through the motion.

Arm Exercises Biceps Curl. This exercise involves lifting a weight held
in the hand by bending the elbow to bring the hands up toward the
shoulders. There are many variations, including using dumbbells, a
barbell, or a machine; you can stand or be seated; and the palms may be
facing out, in, or rotating through the movement. Primary areas worked:
biceps Secondary areas worked: front deltoid Triceps Extension. The
“reverse” of the biceps curl, with the goal being to straighten a bent
arm while holding a weight, then releasing it back into the starting
position. If you’re using a dumbbell, begin leaning over a bench,
supporting yourself with one hand, holding a dumbbell in the other, with
the dumbbell arm pulled back and its elbow bent at a 90-degree angle.
Keeping the upper arm stationary, extend the arm straight out so that
the dumbbell moves backward and up. This can also be done using a
pulley. Primary areas worked: triceps Secondary areas worked: shoulder,
latissimi Bench Dip. Similar to the dip but performed using a weight
bench to support the upper body and with the feet on the ground. Begin
with your hands on the edge of the bench, palms down and supporting your
weight, with your rear end hanging just off the bench and your legs
straight out in front, angling down to the floor so that your heels are
resting on the floor. The fingers should be facing the body and the
elbows close together. The arms are then bent, lowering the body toward
the floor, then straightened so the body is raised. Primary areas
worked: triceps Secondary areas worked: shoulders, chest Leg Exercises
Squat. The goal of this exercise is to “sit” and stand back up while
holding a weight. Starting in a standing position, push the gluteus
muscles backwards and lower yourself as if you are going to sit in a
chair until you are in a squatting position. The upper body leans
slightly forward, toes are pointed straight out in front, feet are
slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. This exercise can be done with
a barbell held across the back, or using a squat machine, a Smith
machine, a hack squat machine, or a Smith ball on the wall. Primary
areas worked: quadriceps, gluteals, hamstrings Secondary areas worked:
back

Leg Press. Similar to a bench press, but it works the leg rather than
the chest muscles. Sit or lie down in a leg press machine, with knees
bent toward the chest and feet against the weight platform. Push hard
with the legs against the platform until the legs straighten but not
entirely; the knees should be slightly bent. Primary areas worked:
quadriceps, gluteals, hamstrings Secondary areas worked: back Leg
Extension. Done on a machine while sitting up, with the legs down and
the ankles pressing up against a padded bar. The legs are lifted with
the feet rising up in an arc, pushing the bar up, until the legs are
straight out in front of the body. Primary areas worked: quadriceps
Secondary areas worked: none, or minor hip flexor action Leg Curl. The
“reverse” of the leg extension, performed lying facedown on a bench with
the Achilles tendons pressed up into a padded bar or sitting up, legs
straight out in front, with the Achilles tendons resting on a padded
bar. The legs are flexed, pushing against the bar until the knees are
bent, with the heel toward the gluteals. Primary areas worked:
hamstrings Secondary areas worked: none, or slight lower back action
Calf Raise. The goal is to stand up on tiptoes against resistance. This
can be done various ways. The simplest is to stand straight up, feet
flat on the ground, holding dumbbells by the sides. Stand up on tiptoes,
then descend back to feet flat on the ground. Primary areas worked:
calves Other benefit: full body stabilization Lunge. The idea is to
“dip” one leg, knee bent, similar to the way a fencer does when lunging
with the foil. Begin in a standing position. Keeping the upper body
erect, step forward so that one leg is in front of the body and one is
behind. Lower the back knee toward the ground, bending the front leg as
well, until the front leg is bent in a perfect 90-degree angle at the
knee. The upper body is kept erect. There are many variations of this
exercise, including holding the lunge while moving up and down, stepping
out and pushing back, and walking. It can be done with dumbbells,
barbells, and using a machine, such as the Smith machine. Primary areas
worked: gluteals, quadriceps, hamstrings Secondary areas worked: low
back, abductors, adductors Step-up. Holding dumbbells at the sides or a
barbell across the back, step up onto a step or low bench (as long as it
is very secure and safe) and then back down. It can be done working one
leg at a time and then the other, or with alternating legs.

Primary areas worked: gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps Secondary areas
worked: low back, abductors, and adductors

Abductor and Adductor Toners. Performed with machines, these exercises
work the “outside” and “inside” of the thighs. To work the muscles on
the outsides of your thighs (abductors), you sit in the machine, legs
straight forward and resting on pads attached to weights, then spread
them out to the sides. To work the muscles on the insides of your thighs
(adductors), you do the reverse, beginning in a seated position, legs
straight out in front but spread, then squeeze them together. Primary
areas worked: abductors, adductors Secondary areas worked: none Dead
Lift. Performed with dumbbells or barbells. Begin in a kneeling
position, with the butt pushed back, upper body leaning forward, and the
toes pointed straight out. The back is kept in alignment, without
rounding. Hands grip the weights, which rest on the floor. Stand up,
using only the legs, with the arms and hands acting only as hooking and
carrying mechanisms. After reaching the standing position, lower the
weight in the same fashion. Primary areas worked: trapezius, latissimi,
erector spinae, gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps, and psoas

ABCT SUMMARY • Exercise in the morning on an empty stomach after an
eight- to 12-hour fast. • Drink 6 ounces of water mixed with 10 grams of
whey protein before starting warm-up or doing any exercise. • Warm up
for five minutes with stretching, flexing, and extension exercises of
the upper and lower body. • Start the resistance portion of ABCT based
on one’s present exercise level, time commitment, and the desired
intensity of the workout. Pick ABCT 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, with varied mixing
and matching to accomplish the goals of bulk, contour, and tone. Do the
intense exercise to the muscle burn. Alternate muscle groups each day
for both upper and lower body, and do core exercises. • Exercise two or
three upper body and two or three lower body muscle groups per session,
and increase the number of muscle groups exercised with your desired
intensity and training time. Do two or three core exercises with some
flexibility and balance work as well. • Ten minutes into the resistance
workout, start drinking 4 ounces of the ABCT Energy Shake at intervals
after each exercise set. Rest sixty seconds between each repetition
unless doing supersets or taking minimal rest periods. • Take
three-second rests as needed to combat muscle fatigue.

• After completing the resistance exercises, start the aerobic program,
utilizing cross-training. • Keep the ratio of resistance training to
aerobic exercise at 2:1. • Exercise at least 6 times per week, but daily
is best with one day off every week if necessary. • Compress the
exercise time and increase training intensity by doing core exercises or
other lower intensity exercises during the sixty-second rest periods.
Alternatively, you can do the core exercises as part of the resistance
exercise session. • Eat the recommended post-exercise breakfast.

ABCT CONCLUSION Optimal exercise with the ABCT combined AE and RT, with
proper nutrition and the energy drink, results in numerous health
benefits, including lowered blood pressure, reduced cardiovascular
disease, and slowed aging. Skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ that
secretes over 400 myokines, hormones, and mediators that result in gene
expression patterns and intracellular and extracellular signaling to
reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and modulate immune function
during chronic adaptive training. An understanding of the
nutrient-gene-muscle interconnections, as it relates to proteomics and
metabolomics will allow for a more scientific recommendation for the
types and duration of exercise coupled with nutritional support to
enhance good health outcomes, reduce morbidity, and mortality.​ Here are
the main elements of ABCT: • Resistance Training. Weight-lifting is
modified to encourage the muscles to “talk” to the body in such a way as
to encourage the better heart and full-body health. ABCT uses graduated
weights and variable repetitions. In brief, lift the heaviest weight you
can twelve times to get the burn, then decrease the weight with each
subsequent set—but keep increasing the number of times you lift that
weight. This is done using five variable weights and repetitions as
follows: • If you do a bench press at 100 pounds for 12 repetitions then
do the following sequence with a 60-second rest between each set. • 75%
of first weight or 75 lbs. for 18 reps. • 50% of first weight or 50 lbs
for 24 reps. • 25% of first weight or 25 lbs. for 50 reps. • 100% of
first weight or 100 lbs. for 12 reps. This maximizes post-exercise
oxygen consumption, depletes glycogen, and increases the production of
lactic acid to achieve all the muscle-, hormone-, cytokine-, and
interleukin-stimulating effects that lead to the health benefits of
exercise. • Aerobic Training in Intervals. Jogging, swimming, biking,
and other forms of continual movement that set the heart beating at an
elevated rate and keep it there for a predetermined amount of time.

TABLE 21.2 ABCT Exercise Program Health Benefits Summary of the
Aerobics, Build, Contour, and Tone Exercise Program The ABCT Exercise
Program has numerous positive effects on body and mind—much more than
the typical aerobic-based programs. Among other things, it: • Reduces
risk of heart disease and heart attack, and lowers risk of recurrent
heart attack • Improves heart function • Lowers blood pressure and
reduces risk of developing hypertension • Reduces total cholesterol,
triglycerides, and LDL • Increases HDL • Reduces body weight and body
fat • Reduces clotting tendencies • Lowers blood sugar and decreases
risk of diabetes • Improves insulin sensitivity • Improves all
abnormalities of metabolic syndrome • Improves immune function • Reduces
risk of stroke • Reduces risk of certain cancers, such as colon, breast,
and prostate • Improves memory and focus and reduces risk of Alzheimer’s
disease and dementia • Improves skin tone and, elasticity and decreases
wrinkles • Improves depression, stress, anxiety, and overall
psychological well-being • Improves sleep

approach—keeping the heart beating at a certain elevated rate for 20,
30, or even 60 minutes—is faulty. The best technique is aerobic interval
training, which consists of short periods ranging from 20 to 60 seconds
of “burst” aerobic training at 80–90% of your maximal aerobic capacity
(MAC) or heart rate for your age, then dropping to 50% of the MAC or
heart rate for three times the length of the initial burst of activity.
You then repeat this six times. The length of your burst of activity and
resting period will depend on your present level of exercise
conditioning. For example, if you run for 20 seconds at 80% MAC then you
would do 60 seconds at 50% MAC. This more closely mimics the natural
activities we evolved to perform and benefit from and strings together
several periods of intense and semi-intense activity into a single,
longer exercise period that still burns calories and builds endurance. •
Proper Ratio of Aerobic Training to Resistance Training. The optimal
ratio of resistance to interval aerobic training should be 2:1. For
example, during a 60-minute workout, you would perform 40 minutes of
resistance training and 20 minutes of interval aerobics, with the
aerobics coming after the resistance training. This should be done at
least four days per week but daily is the best to achieve cardiovascular
conditioning and optimal body composition with increases in lean muscle
mass and reduction in body fat (Table 21.3).

WEIGHT MANAGEMENT, BODY FAT, AND VISCERAL FAT Obesity by itself is a
well-known risk factor for CHD and MI, and losing weight and body fat
will help to lower your blood pressure, serum lipids, blood sugar, and
other cardiovascular risks. Total body fat, especially visceral or belly
fat produces over 45 chemicals, called “adipokines” that can elevate
blood pressure, cause inflammation,

oxidative stress, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. About
60% of hypertensive patients are at least 20% over ideal body weight. A
weight loss of about 10–12 pounds will result in a reduction in blood
pressure of 7/5 mm Hg in obese and nonobese patients. Weight loss also
potentiates the effects of other lifestyle modifications and drug
therapy. Weight reduction should decrease adipose tissue, not lean
muscle mass. Reduction in visceral obesity, which is measured by the
waist circumference and by a machine called body impedance analysis
(BIA), is particularly important in reducing blood pressure and
cardiovascular risk (Figure 21.1). Weight loss with fat loss improves
the output of the heart, decreases blood volume, sodium and water
retention, and swelling in the legs (edema). In addition, weight and fat
loss reduce insulin levels, improves insulin sensitivity, lowers
adrenalin levels, dilates the arteries, reduces the sympathetic nervous
system activity, plasma renin activity (PRA), and serum aldosterone
levels. Weight and fat loss reduce inflammation and oxidative stress.
Here are some important and practical points about weight and body fat
reduction. 1. It is not safe to lose over 3.3 pounds per week, and the
preferred weight loss is 1–2 pounds per week. 2. Body fat is more
important than body weight. Males should be &lt; 15% body fat. Females
should be &lt; 22% body fat. 3. The number of calories needed per day to
maintain the same weight is your weight in pounds times 10. That is, 160
lbs. = 1600 calories. 1600 calories is your basal metabolic rate (BMR).
4. It takes a 3500-calorie deficit to lose one pound. 2. If the body
mass index (BMI) is over 27, there is a danger of developing significant
health problems. 6. Four major factors contribute to obesity: •
Genetics. • Metabolic factors. • Diet. • Physical inactivity. 7. Waist
circumference, taken around the natural waistline, over the value
indicated below is associated with a high risk of disease and may be the
single best predictor of obesity-related cardiovascular disease and
overall morbidity and mortality: men over 40 inches and women over 35
inches. 8. Neck circumference also correlates with high disease risk.
Men over 15.6 inches Women over 14.4 inches 9. Obesity will increase the
risk of morbidity and mortality from the following diseases: •
Hypertension.

heart disease and heart attack. • Stroke. • Gallbladder disease. •
Osteoarthritis. • Sleep apnea. • Respiratory problems. • Cancer of
breast, prostate, colon, and endometrium. • Chronic kidney disease. •
Microalbuminuria and proteinuria. 10. The ideal body weight calculation:
(Depends on the body frame size) • Women: 100 lbs. first 5 feet, then 5
lbs. for each additional inch of height. • Men: 106 lbs. first 5 feet,
then 6 lbs. for each additional inch of height. • 10% is added for large
frame and you delete 10% for a small frame.

SUMMARY OF THE CHD NUTRITION PROGRAM 1. Vegetables: eat 8–12 servings
per day of non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, leafy
greens, asparagus. 2. Fruit: limit to four servings. ½ cup of pieces =
one serving. 1 small whole fruit = one serving. 3. Fats: eat good fats,
avoid some saturated fats, and avoid all trans fats. Omega-3 fatty acids
(1–2 grams per day), extra virgin olive oil (four tablespoons per day),
and olive products. 4. Protein: 25–30% clean-sourced fish, turkey,
chicken, and proteins. Organic meat and grass-fed beef. Avoid any animal
product with pesticides, toxins, or hormones. Avoid farm-raised fish.
Wild coldwater fish, like cod, mackerel, salmon, halibut, and tuna, are
best. 5. Water: 50% of body weight (pounds) in ounces of filtered or
distilled water per day. If you weigh 150 pounds, that is 75 ounces of
water, herbal teas, broths daily. (Do not consume from plastic.) 6. Tea:
16 ounces of decaffeinated green tea per day. 7. Pomegranate: ¼ cup of
pomegranate seeds per day. 8. Detox + elimination diet: followed by an
anti-inflammatory, blood sugar regulating protocol. Emphasize high-fiber
foods and add servings of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli,
cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage, etc. 9. Caloric restriction
(CR): 12–14 hours overnight fast with 12.5% caloric restriction and
12.5% increase in energy expenditure with exercise. PREDIMED
(Mediterranean) type diet. 10. Fasting Mimicking Diet (PROLON): three
months on, then three months off and repeat.

Chapters 12 and 13 on Nutrition and CHD discusses all the effective
nutrition recommendations to safely reduce body weight, body fat,
visceral (belly) fat; preserve lean muscle mass; decrease CHD risk;
lower blood pressure; reduce blood glucose and cholesterol and other
cardiovascular and general health risks. ​

TOBACCO PRODUCTS, E-CIGARETTES, AND VAPING Smoking is a major risk
factor for heart attack, coronary heart disease, congestive heart
failure, stroke, chronic obstructive lung disease, and lung cancer.
Smoking accounts for over 500,000 deaths per year in the US. It is very
addictive, so you must seek your doctor’s help in stopping this very bad
habit. Second-hand smoke, e-cigarettes, vaping, and other forms of
tobacco should also be stopped. It is never too late to quit!
Discontinuation of smoking will reduce vasoconstriction, improve
endothelial function, and lower blood pressure. It also decreases
sympathetic nervous system activity, norepinephrine levels, RAAS
activity, carbon monoxide levels, platelet stickiness, clotting risk,
oxidative stress, and inflammation. All tobacco products must be
stopped, such as chewing tobacco, snuff, e-cigarettes, vaping, and
others. Here are some encouraging facts to help you quit smoking. •
Quitting smoking decreases CHD and cardiovascular risk. At about one
year after quitting smoking, your risk for a heart attack drops
dramatically. • Within two to five years after quitting smoking, your
risk for stroke may fall to that of a nonsmoker’s. • If you stop
smoking, your risks for cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and
bladder drop by 50% within 5 years. • Ten years after you discontinue
smoking, your risk for dying from lung cancer drops by 50%.

CONTROL ALL RISK FACTORS FOR CORONARY HEART DISEASE All CHD risk factors
should be measured, identified early, and treated aggressively to the
optimal levels. The top 5 and top 25 are the best starting risk factors
to evaluate. See Chapter 18 for a detailed discussion. These are the Top
5: 1. Hypertension: in addition to office and home BP monitory, the new
gold standard to evaluate BP and CHD risk is the 24-hour ambulatory
blood pressure monitoring (ABM) discussed in the Hypertension section.
Goal BP is 120/80 mm Hg. 2. Dyslipidemia: an advanced blood lipid
analysis that measures all the different lipid particle numbers and
sizes as well a test to determine the function of HDL is much more
accurate than the old standard lipid profiles. Goals are defined for
each lipid value including LDL P to below 1000, LDL to below 100 mg/dL,
TG to 75 mg/dL, HDL P to over 5000, HDL above 50 mg/dL and good HDL
function. 3. Hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and
diabetes mellitus: evaluate all blood tests to determine the fasting
glucose, twohour GTT, insulin levels and HbA1C. Fasting blood sugar
should be about 75 mg /dL with hemoglobin A1C below 5.5 units.

4.  Obesity: measure the total body fat, regional fat, visceral fat, and
    lean muscle with the BIA and get to 16% in men and 22% in women.
5.  Smoking and all tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and vaping: must be
    stopped immediately.​

SUMMARY AND KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS 1. Nutrition is the foundation for the
prevention and treatment of CHD and should follow the general guidelines
of the Mediterranean diet. Also consider caloric restriction and fasting
programs. 2. Numerous nutritional supplements have proven scientific
validity to improve numerous CHD risk factors, noninvasive
cardiovascular tests, coronary calcium, and plaque stabilization and
reduction. 3. A combined aerobic and resistance exercise program is
recommended for the prevention and treatment of CHD. This is the ABCT
exercise program. 4. Achieving the ideal body weight, BMI, and body fat
will improve CHD risk. 5. Stop all tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and
vaping. 6. Control all risk factors for CHD to the new recommended
goals.

Medicines for CHD

Many different medicines are used to treat coronary heart disease (CHD)
by reducing the CHD risk factors. You should consult with your personal
physician regarding all drug treatments for CHD.

BLOOD-THINNING MEDICINES Blood thinners are a type of medicine that can
help reduce the risk of a heart attack by thinning your blood and
preventing it from clotting. Antithrombotic drugs in routine use include
1. Antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
receptor antagonists). 2. Anticoagulants (unfractionated and low
molecular weight heparin, warfarin, and direct thrombin inhibitors). 3.
Factor X inhibitors. Factor X Inhibitors Xarelto Generic name:
rivaroxaban Eliquis Generic name: apixaban Arixtra Generic name:
fondaparinux Savaysa Generic name: edoxaban Bevyxxa Generic name:
betrixaban

STATINS Statins (also called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) block an
enzyme called HMGCoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
reductase) that is involved in the synthesis of mevalonate, a naturally
occurring substance that is then used by the body to make sterols,
including cholesterol. By inhibiting this enzyme, cholesterol and
LDL-cholesterol production are decreased. Statins also increase the
number of LDL receptors on liver cells, which enhances the uptake and
breakdown of LDL cholesterol. Most of the effects of statins (including
the blocking of the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme) occur in the liver.

Grand Summary and Conclusions

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the number-one cause of death in the US
and worldwide. We have reached a limit in our ability to prevent and
treat CHD with current concepts, prevention, and treatment strategies.
Coronary heart disease is preventable and treatable. It starts in utero
or at a very early age. Endothelial dysfunction and glycocalyx
dysfunction are the earliest vascular findings in CHD and precede the
clinical symptoms and events, such as MI by decades. Coronary heart
disease is the result of atheromatous changes and plaque formation in
the coronary arteries supplying the heart. Approximately 80% of the
cases of coronary heart disease can be prevented by achieving optimal
nutrition, optimal exercise, optimal weight, and body fat; stress and
anxiety reduction; and avoiding all tobacco products and smokeless
tobacco. The three finite responses of the coronary arteries and
cardiovascular system to the infinite insults are vascular inflammation,
vascular oxidative stress, and vascular immune dysfunction. The top five
CHD treatable risk factors are hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
dyslipidemia (abnormal cholesterol), obesity, and smoking. These must be
redefined, measured accurately, and treated early and aggressively. It
is also important to measure and treat the top 25 CHD risk factors.
However, there are over 400 known risk factors. Genetics and family
history are most important as discussed in Chapters 9 and 10. Coronary
heart disease is caused by a reduction in the blood supply due to
obstruction by a plaque in one or more of the coronary arteries to the
heart muscle (myocardium), which results in decreased delivery of fresh
blood, oxygen, and nutrients. Less commonly, vasospasm may cause CHD.
The plaque is made up of fatty material, oxidized cholesterol and fats,
inflammatory cells, white blood cells, immune cells, smooth muscle
cells, and other substances. The top five CHD risk factors
(hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia (abnormal cholesterol),
obesity, and smoking) must be redefined based on new information, and
the top 25 CHD risk factors need to be assessed as well. There are
actually over 400 risk factors for CHD. There are an infinite number of
insults to the coronary artery to cause CHD but only three finite
responses: inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular immune
dysfunction. Seventy-five percent of myocardial infarctions are caused
by unstable plaque rupture and a blood clot (thrombus) in a coronary
artery without previous angina symptoms. The symptoms and signs of CHD
and MI can be mild or severe, typical or atypical, and will vary
depending on your gender. If you develop any of these then go to the
nearest emergency room or hospital. Time is critical in dealing with an
MI and may truly save your heart and your life.

The arteries have five parts: lumen, glycocalyx, endothelium, muscle
(media), and adventitia. The endothelium and the glycocalyx are like the
air traffic control systems of the coronary arteries (as well as other
arteries) and determine what happens in the blood and the subendothelial
lining and the artery muscle, such as clotting, leakage or contraction
of the muscle, hypertension, vasodilation, growth, inflammation,
oxidative stress or immune dysfunction of the artery, atherosclerosis,
arteriosclerosis, and CHD. The endothelium makes nitric oxide and many
other substances which helps to reduce blood pressure, atherosclerosis,
arteriosclerosis, CHD, and MI. Glycocalyx dysfunction (GD) and
endothelial dysfunction (ED) of the coronary arteries may precede the
development of CHD by decades. There are many treatments for endothelial
dysfunction and glycocalyx dysfunction that are discussed. The coronary
arteries have only three finite or final responses that are generated
from a large number of environmental and internal insults, coupled with
our genetics and our nutrition. These are vascular inflammation,
oxidative stress, and immune dysfunction. Inflammation in the coronary
arteries is part of the injury process that repairs and heals the acute
damage to the glycocalyx and endothelium. But if it is chronic, then the
arteries become innocent bystanders to more damage leading to CHD.
Inflammation can be measured in the blood using HS-CRP, interleukins,
TNF alpha, and other inflammatory markers. There are many foods and
supplements that reduce inflammation. Oxidation is a normal process in
the body that uses oxygen to make energy that is needed for life. But if
there is an imbalance with more oxidative stress than oxidative defense,
then CHD is more common. Oxidative stress can be measured in the blood
with many tests. There are many effective foods and supplements to
provide an oxidative defense. Vascular immune dysfunction involves types
of WBCs such as leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, T cells, and
macrophages that attempt to control the invasion of the glycocalyx and
endothelium of the artery by LDL cholesterol. All three finite vascular
responses occur at the same time and lead to foam cells, fatty streaks,
and atherosclerotic plaque that may rupture and form a clot (thrombus)
in the artery leading to MI. CHD starts early in life, but it can be
identified with new cardiovascular testing which will allow early and
aggressive prevention and treatment. Assessment of the three finite
vascular responses, removing the vascular insult(s), and measuring
correctly all the CHD risk factors coupled with personalized and
precision cardiovascular program and genetics will help to reduce CHD
and MI. There are many causes of chest pain. Some of these are serious
and life threatening. Angina chest pain or MI can have variable types of
chest pain depending on age, gender, and other issues. If you have chest
pain, with or without other symptoms, you need to get an immediate
medical evaluation by your doctor, the emergency department, or
hospital. Do not wait and assume that the chest pain is not serious.
Your life can depend on rapid action and evaluation. Our modern
nutrition is not healthy. We consume too much sodium, refined sugars,
bad fats (trans fats and some saturated fats), omega-6 fatty acids, but
not enough potassium, magnesium, fruit, fiber, vegetables, high-quality
protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and monounsaturated fats. These
nutritional habits contribute to CHD and

MI. Your genes interact with your nutrition and your environment (gene
    expression) to determine your risk for CHD and MI. You can test many
    CHD genes with CARDIA-X from Vibrant America Labs (see the Sources
    section). If one of your parents had a MI at an early age, you have
    a higher chance of having an MI. Numerous genes that cause CHD and
    hypertension can have their genetic expression altered with
    nutrition, supplements, exercise, drugs, and lifestyle. Evaluate
    specific genetic SNPs for CHD and CHD risk factors using the
    CARDIA-X genetic profile. The traditional Mediterranean diet (TMD)
    with five tablespoons EVOO/day (50 grams), nuts, and CoQ10 reduces
    the risk for CHD. Omega-3 fatty acids should be given to all
    patients, dose dependent (1–5 grams per day) to lower blood pressure
    and reduce CHD and MI risk. Avoid caffeine in CYP 1A2 SNP, if a slow
    metabolizer of caffeine, to reduce the risk of CHD and MI. Selective
    use of ASA and vitamin E depending on COMT phenotype. Methyl folate
    and B vitamins depend on the MTHFR genotype for methylation.
    Selenium should be given with the GSH-Px gene if defective. All of
    the genes listed in the Vibrant CARDIA-X testing have specific
    treatments that will modify the gene expression to reduce CHD risk
    and CHD risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, blood
    glucose, and the three finite responses. These include treatments
    with nutrition, nutritional supplements, lifestyle, and medications.
    The gut microbiome has more genes than are in the human genome. The
    gut microbes help with the digestion of nutrients, prevent
    significant colonization of pathogens, and promote gut immunity,
    while the host provides a favorable environment for microbial
    survival. The microbiome has direct effects on the risk for CHD, MI,
    hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. A
    damaged or leaky gut allows bacteria and other products into the
    blood and causes endotoxemia, inflammation, and arterial damage. CHD
    is a post-meal disease. Eating healthy foods and taking specific
    supplements before eating will reduce arterial damage, higher blood
    sugar, and triglycerides. The treatments to repair the gut include
    proper nutrition with a low intake of long-chain SFA, TFA, and
    sugars, such as glucose and fructose. You should consume more
    fruits, vegetables, fiber, prebiotics, probiotics, omega-3 fatty
    acids, olive products, specific vitamins, minerals, and glutamine.
    Avoid long-term use of medications that block acid production in
    your stomach, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 blockers,
    as they will increase the risk for endothelial dysfunction, lower
    nitric oxide, and increase the risk of CHD and MI. The role of
    nutrition in the prevention and treatment of CHD has been clearly
    demonstrated in published clinical trials. The top five
    cardiovascular risk factors, as presently defined, are not an
    adequate explanation for the current limitations to prevent and
    reduce CHD. The three finite responses and sound nutritional advice
    and evaluation based on scientific studies will be required to
    effect an improvement in risk for CHD. Early detection of CHD
    coupled with aggressive prevention and treatment of all
    cardiovascular risk factors will diminish the progression of
    functional and structural cardiovascular abnormalities and clinical
    CHD. Utilization of targeted personalized and precision treatments
    that apply genetics with optimal nutrition coupled with exercise,
    ideal weight, and body composition, and discontinuation of all
    tobacco

use can prevent approximately 80% of CHD. Nutritional studies provide
evidence that CHD can be reduced with a weighted plant-based diet with
ten servings of fruits and vegetables per day, MUFA, PUFA, nuts, whole
grains, cold water fish, the DASH diets, PREDIMED-TMD diet; reduction of
refined carbohydrates and sugars, sucrose, sugar substitutes, high
fructose corn syrup, long-chain SFAs, processed foods, and elimination
of all TFA. Eggs and dairy products are not associated with CHD. Coconut
oil is neutral for CHD risk. Organic grass-fed beef and wild game may
reduce CHD. High intakes of potassium and magnesium are recommended in
conjunction with sodium restriction. Caffeine intake should be adjusted,
depending on the genetic ability to metabolize it via the CYP 1A2
system. Alcohol is associated with a U-shaped curve and CHD. The role of
gluten, soy, and caloric restriction and CHD in humans will require more
studies.

EATING A HEALTHY HEART DIET IS EASY, TASTES GOOD, AND CAN PREVENT CHD 1.
Vegetables. Eat 8–12 servings per day of non-starchy vegetables, such as
broccoli, cauliflower, leafy greens, asparagus. 2. Fruit. Limit to four
servings. ½ cup of pieces = one serving. One small whole fruit = one
serving. 3. Fats. Eat good fats and avoid some saturated fats and all
trans fats. Omega-3 fatty acids (1–2 grams per day), extra virgin olive
oil (four tablespoons per day), and olive products. 4. Protein: 25–30%
clean-sourced fish, turkey, chicken, and proteins. Organic meat,
grass-fed beef. Avoid any animal product with pesticides, toxins, or
hormones. Avoid farm-raised fish. Wild cold water fish, like cod,
mackerel, salmon, halibut, and tuna, are best. 5. Water. Fifty percent
of body weight (pounds) in ounces of filtered or distilled water per
day. If you weigh 150 pounds that is 75 ounces of water, herbal teas,
broths daily. Do not drink from plastic containers or bottles. 6. Tea.
Sixteen ounces of decaffeinated green tea per day. 7. Pomegranate.
One-quarter cup of pomegranate seeds per day. 8. Detox + elimination
diet, followed by an anti-inflammatory, blood sugarregulating protocol.
Emphasize high-fiber foods and add servings of cruciferous vegetables,
such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage, etc. 9.
Caloric restriction (CR). Fasting 12–14 hours overnight fast with 12.5%
caloric restriction and 12.5% increase in energy expenditure with
exercise. PREDIMED (Mediterranean)-type diet. 10. FMD (Fasting Mimicking
Diet) (PROLON). Three months on, then three months off, and repeat.

Chronic stress, anxiety, and depression increase the risk of CHD and MI
through an imbalance of the ANS with increased SNS activity. The
autonomic nervous system is a balance of the SNS, PNS, and ENS.
Increased and chronic activation of the SNS is a CHD risk factor and
needs to be reduced and controlled. Increased SNS activity causes heart
and arterial inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular immune
dysfunction. Increased SNS via NE activity elevates blood pressure,
heart rate, other cardiovascular problems, and many endocrine problems,
such as elevated blood sugar, adrenaline, and cortisol. The PNS via Ach
reduces inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular immune dysfunction.
The SNS and PNS must be balanced to reduce the risk of CHD. There are
many treatments to balance the autonomic nervous system including
lifestyle, nutrition, exercise, herbs, and supplements. Myocardial
infarction is due to plaque in the coronary arteries. The final stage of
MI is a thrombosis in the coronary artery. The primary types of plaque
are hard plaque (or stable plaque), which is more obstructive, and soft
rupture-prone plaque that is not as obstructive. They have different
compositions and clinical presentations. About 75% of MIs are caused by
soft rupture-prone plaque. The formation of plaque starts as glycocalyx
and endothelial dysfunction and progresses over decades through many
stages to become complicated plaque. Most MIs occur without any previous
symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or other cardiovascular
symptoms. Early subendothelial plaque is extraluminal and may not be
detectable with a routine coronary arteriogram but can be seen with CAC,
MRA of the heart, IVUS, and CTA of the heart. There are many supplements
and medications that will reduce plaque size and stabilize the plaque by
stabilizing and reducing the lipid core. In addition to severe
obstructive CHD, patients may have NO-CHD or CA-VS that cause anginal
chest pain, tightness, pressure, shortness of breath, and MI. The
underlying cause for both NO-CHD and CA-VS is a reduction in arterial
nitric oxide and possible vascular inflammation, oxidative stress, and
immune dysfunction. The diagnosis is made with cardiac monitors and by
injection of certain drugs into the coronary artery during a coronary
angiogram. The treatment is with nitrates, calcium channel blockers,
statins, alpha blockers, and some natural compounds that increase
arterial nitric oxide. CHD and MI are the number-one causes of death in
women in the US. The symptoms of CHD and MI in women are often different
than they are in men. The CHD risk factors may also be different in
women than in men. Women are often diagnosed later than men and may have
a poorer prognosis. Women tend to have worse results from PTCA, stents,
and CABG compared to men. After menopause the risk for CHD and MI
increase due to a reduction in estrogen, increased inflammation, changes
in blood lipids, and other factors. The top five CHD risk factors must
be redefined and evaluated accurately and treated in all patients. The
top modifiable 25 CHD risk factors should now be included in the
evaluation of patients with any risk of CHD or known CHD. Other CHD risk
factors, metabolomics, and proteomics in blood and urine are now
emerging and will be important in the future evaluation of CHD risk.
Early measurement of the top 25 modifiable CHD risk factors and early,
aggressive, and appropriate prevention and treatment will help prevent
and reduce CHD and MI.

Several noninvasive vascular tests will predict the risk for CHD or MI
decades before an event occurs. These noninvasive vascular tests will
predict the presence and severity of CHD and the risk for MI. Numerous
supporting blood tests also predict CHD and MI. All of these tests are
available clinically. Immediate prevention and treatment programs can be
started to correct these abnormal tests and prevent the progression of
CHD or an MI. Nutrition is the foundation for the prevention and
treatment of CHD and should follow the general guidelines of the
Mediterranean diet. Also consider caloric restriction and fasting
programs. Numerous nutritional supplements have proven scientific
validity to improve numerous CHD risk factors, noninvasive
cardiovascular tests, coronary calcium, and plaque stabilization and
reduction. A combined aerobic and resistance exercise program is
recommended for the prevention and treatment of CHD. This is the ABCT
exercise program. The ideal body weight, BMI, and body fat will improve
CHD risk. Stop all tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and vaping. Control
all risk factors for CHD and adhere to the new recommended goals.
